</div></div></div>

<p>Our story opens in spring of 1797, in a sequestered
valley in Western Pennsylvania. On a green hillside
dotted here and there with stately oaks and elms, and
sloping toward the road, beyond which flowed the clear
waters of a mountain stream, stood a brick farm-house&mdash;large,
roomy, substantial; beautiful with climbing vines
and flowering shrubs. Orchard, meadow, wheat and
corn fields stretched away on either hand, shut in by dense
forests and wooded hills; beyond and above which,
toward the right, towered the giant Alleghenies; their
summits, still white from the storms of the past winter,
lying like a bank of snowy clouds against the eastern
horizon.</p>

<p>But night drew on apace, the light was fast fading even
from the mountain tops, and down in the valley it was
already so dark that only the outlines of objects close at
hand were discernible as our hero, Kenneth Clendenin,
mounted upon Romeo, his gallant steed, entered it from
the west and slowly wended his way toward its one
solitary dwelling. The road was familiar to both man
and horse, and ere long they had reached the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
A negro boy perched on the top of the fence, with his
hands in his pockets, whistling softly to himself in the
dark, broke off suddenly in the middle of his tune, sprang
nimbly to the ground and took the bridle, exclaiming,
"Ki, Massa Doctah! t'o't dat you and ole Romeo comin'
up de road. Ole Aunt Vashti she tole me watch out
hyar an' ax you ef you's had yo' suppah, sah?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Zeb, tell her I have and shall want nothing
more to-night," answered the traveller, alighting. "Rub
Romeo down and give him a good feed."</p>

<p>"Dat I will, Massa Doctah; I neber 'glects ole
Romeo," returned the lad, vaulting into the saddle and
cantering off to the stable, while the gentleman walked
quickly up the path leading to the house.</p>

<p>Within a wood fire burned brightly in the wide chimney
of the living room. An arm-chair stood on each side
of the hearth, the master of the house occupying one,
his wife the other, she with her knitting, he half crouching
over the fire, watching the flickering flames in moody
silence.</p>

<p>At a table on the farther side of the room, a little
girl was poring over a book by the light of a tallow
candle. She had seemed very intent upon its pages, but
at the first sound of the approaching footsteps sprang up
and ran to open the door.</p>

<p>"At last, Kenneth!" she cried, in a joyous but subdued
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, little sister," he said, laying his hand caressingly
for an instant on her pretty brown hair, and smiling into
the bright, dark eyes. "I'm glad to find you up, I
thought you went to bed with the chickens."</p>

<p>"Not to-night&mdash;the last&mdash;O Kenneth! Kenneth!"
and she burst into passionate weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
"Marian, my little pet sister," he whispered, sitting
down and drawing her to his breast with a tender caress,
"try to be cheerful for mother's sake."</p>

<p>"I will," she answered, hastily wiping away her tears.
"I have a parting present for you, Kenneth," she went on
with a determined effort to seem bright and gay; "a pair
of stockings made of my own lamb's wool, and every
stitch knit by my own fingers&mdash;I took the last to-night,
and you're to travel in them."</p>

<p>"Many thanks," he said, "my feet will surely keep
warm in such hose, though the nights are still very
cool."</p>

<p>"Yes, come nearer to the fire, Kenneth," said the
mother, who had been watching the two, silently, but
with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>She was a woman of middle age, gentle mannered, with
a low and peculiarly sweet-toned voice, a tall and stately
figure, and a face that told a story of trial and sorrow
borne with patience and resignation.</p>

<p>Kenneth resembled her strongly in person and manner,
he had the same noble contour of features&mdash;the
broad high forehead, the large dark gray eye, keen yet
tender in expression.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, coming forward and taking
his stand upon the hearth, where the firelight fell full upon
his tall, manly form, "its warmth is by no means unpleasant."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Kenneth; sit down, and take me on your
knee," said Marian, bringing him a chair.</p>

<p>"Are you not growing rather large and heavy for
that?" the mother asked with a slight smile, as Kenneth
good-humoredly complied with the request.</p>

<p>"I'll be bigger and heavier before he has another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
chance," remarked the child, putting an arm about
Kenneth's neck and gazing wistfully into his eyes.</p>

<p>"But not too big, never too big, to take your seat
here," he responded, drawing her closer. "Ah, there will
be many a lonely hour when I shall long for my little
sister, long to feel her weight upon my knee, her arm
about my neck, just as I feel them now."</p>

<p>"Why do you all talk so much?" queried the older man
sharply, speaking for the first time since Kenneth's
entrance, and turning somewhat angrily toward the little
group. "You leave me no peace of my life with your
incessant gabble, gabble."</p>

<p>With the last word he rose and withdrew to an inner
room.</p>

<p>No one answered or tried to detain him: the shade of
sadness deepened slightly on the mother's calm face, and
Marian's arm tightened its hold on Kenneth's neck, but
no one spoke and the room was very still for a moment.</p>

<p>Then the mother, glancing at the dial-plate of a tall
old-fashioned clock, ticking in a corner, said, "Marian,
my child, it is growing late, and you will want to be up
betimes in the morning."</p>

<p>The little girl, heaving a sigh, reluctantly bade them
good-night and retired.</p>

<p>Kenneth looked after her.</p>

<p>"What a sweet creature she is! what a lovely woman
a few years will make of her," he said; but catching the
expression of the mother's countenance, he ended
abruptly, with almost a groan.</p>

<p>She had dropped her knitting in her lap, her face had
grown very pale, her lips quivered, and there was a look
of anguish in her eyes.</p>

<p>Kenneth longed to comfort her, but could find no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
words. He brought a glass of water and held it to her
lips.</p>

<p>She swallowed a mouthful, and as he set the glass down
on a stand by her side, took up her work again with a
slight sigh. The spasm of pain seemed to have passed,
and her face resumed its accustomed expression of patient
endurance.</p>

<p>He stood gazing down on her, his eyes full of a wistful
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, bending over her and speaking in a
voice scarce raised above a whisper, "our God is very
good, very merciful, surely He will hear our united
prayers that it&mdash;that fearful curse&mdash;may never light on
her."</p>

<p>"His will be done with me and mine," she answered
low and tremulously. "Though He slay me, yet will I
trust in Him."</p>

<p>He turned and paced the room for several minutes,
then came back to her side.</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;am I right to go and leave you thus?&mdash;alone&mdash;unprotected,
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up with a great courage in her noble face.
"Yes, go, Kenneth; I do not fear, and it is best for you
and for him. You forget how fully we have both been
convinced of that."</p>

<p>"How brave you are, how strong in faith!" he cried
admiringly.</p>

<p>She shook her head in dissent. "You do not know
how my heart fails me at times when I think of my dear
boy far away in that Northwestern Territory fighting his
battle with the world among strangers, often exposed to
the pitiless storms, or in danger from wild beasts or
savage Indians; coming home from his long rides over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
prairies and through forests, wet, cold, and weary, and
finding no one to cheer him and comfort him."</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes and in her voice.</p>

<p>"Don't be troubled about me," Kenneth said
cheerily, "I am young and vigorous, and shall rather
enjoy roughing it, in the pursuit of my calling?"</p>

<p>"A noble calling to one who follows it in the right
spirit, Kenneth. Your arrangements are all completed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we meet at the cross-roads an hour after sunrise."</p>

<p>She gave him a troubled, anxious look, opened her
lips as if to speak, then closed them again.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?" he asked. "Why should you
hesitate to say to me all that is in your heart?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lamar! I saw her the other day. She is sweet
and fair to look upon, and very winsome in her ways,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was left unfinished, while her eyes sought
his with a yearning, wistful look.</p>

<p>"I will be on my guard," he said, huskily. "I know
that marriage is not for me&mdash;as a physician I am convinced
of it as another might not be&mdash;unless&mdash;oh, there
will come to me, at times, a wild hope that there may one
day be an end to this suspense&mdash;this torturing doubt and
fear!"</p>

<p>"Too many years have passed," she answered sadly.
"I have no longer any expectation that it will ever be
cleared up this side the grave."</p>

<p>"Do not say it," he entreated, "it must be done! I
shall never resign hope till&mdash;I have attained to some certainty;
and yet, and yet&mdash;in either case it must be grief
of heart to me."</p>

<p>"My poor boy!" she murmured, regarding him with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
tenderly compassionate gaze; then after a pause, "Kenneth,"
she remarked, "there is little Clendenin about
you except the name; you strongly resemble my mother's
family in both disposition and personal appearance."</p>

<p>"And yet," he said, with a melancholy smile, "there is
nothing more certain than that I am a Clendenin."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, gazing upon him with loving pride,
yet with eyes dim with unshed tears, "it is a family of no
mean extraction; and an honest, pious ancestry is something
to be thankful for."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_ii" id="chapter_ii">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Kenneth Clendenin, having completed his medical
studies at Philadelphia, graduated with honor, and afterward
spent a year in the hospitals there, was now about
emigrating to Chillicothe, a town recently laid out by
General Nathaniel Massie, in what was then the Northwestern
Territory; now the state of Ohio.</p>

<p>None of his family were to accompany him, but he was
to act as escort to two ladies, who, with their children,
were also going thither to join their husbands. One
of them had under her care a young orphan girl, bound
to the same place, where she was to make her home with
a married brother, Major Lamar.</p>

<p>The Clendenin household were early astir on the morning
succeeding the events related in the former chapter.
Before the sun had peeped above the mountain tops they
were summoned to a savory and substantial breakfast,
prepared by old Vashti, who had been cook in the family
since Kenneth's earliest recollection.</p>

<p>He was the first to answer the call; coming in from a
farewell tramp about the premises, to find the faithful
old creature in the act of setting the last dish upon the
table.</p>

<p>"I'se done my bes', honey," she said to him, with tears
in her eyes. "It mos' breaks dis ole heart to tink you
won't eat no mo' dis chile's cookin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
"I don't know that, Aunt Vashti," he responded, smiling,
"I'm not going quite out of the world."</p>

<p>"'Pears mighty like it, honey," she said; then seeing
his eyes wandering uneasily about the room and the
porch beyond, "You's lookin' for ole marster?" she
whispered, coming close to his side. "He was off to de
woods wid his gun 'fore daylight. 'Spect he didn't want
to say good-by."</p>

<p>"Probably," he answered, with a slight sigh; then
turned with an affectionate greeting to his mother and
Marian, who entered the room at that instant.</p>

<p>They sat down at once to their repast, without the husband
and father, no one remarking upon his absence, or
asking any questions in regard to it; the meal was,
indeed, almost a silent one; the hearts were too full for
much speech.</p>

<p>Kenneth's saddle-bags and portmanteau were in readiness,
packed by the mother's loving hands, and Romeo
stood pawing at the gate. Zeb's horse, too, was there,
tied to the fence near by, while its rider was eating his
breakfast in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The travelers had no time for loitering, for many
miles of rough road must be passed over that day.</p>

<p>The adieus were quickly spoken, and the windings of
the road soon hid master and servant from the view of
the weeping, disconsolate Marian and her sorrowful-faced
mother.</p>

<p>Kenneth's heart, too, was heavy, spite of the cheerful air
he had assumed for the sake of the dear ones he was
leaving behind; but Zeb seemed in fine spirits. He was
young and light-hearted, had no relatives to leave, in fact
loved "de doctah" better than any other human creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
And he was going to see the world, a prospect which
thrilled him with delight.</p>

<p>The sun was now shining brightly, birds sang cheerily
in the trees that bordered the roadside, the morning air
was fresh and exhilarating, and Zeb's spirits rose high
as he cantered along at a respectful distance behind his
master.</p>

<p>A mile away from Glen Forest, as the Clendenin place
was called, they came out upon a cleared place where
stood a little country church in the midst of an enclosure,
whose grass-covered mounds, with here and there a stone
slab, proclaimed it the settlers' last resting place.</p>

<p>Here Kenneth drew rein, and calling to Zeb bade him
ride on to the cross-roads and there await his coming;
and if their fellow travellers should arrive first, tell them
he would join them in a few moments.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," returned the lad, whipping up his horse,
while Kenneth dismounted and made his way to a spot
where four or five little graves, and one somewhat longer,
were ranged side by side.</p>

<p>Giving only a glance at the others, the young man
turned to this last and stood for some moments gazing
down upon it with a look of grave, sad tenderness upon
his noble, manly face.</p>

<p>"Angus Clendenin, aged fourteen," he murmured in
low, moved tones, reading from the inscription on the
headstone. "Ah, brother beloved, why were we so soon
parted by grim death? We whose hearts were knit
together as the hearts of David and Jonathan!"</p>

<p>But time pressed and he must away. Plucking a violet
from the sod that covered the sleeping dust, and placing
it carefully between the leaves of his note book, he
remounted and pursued his journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
As he reached the place of rendezvous, where Zeb was
lazily sunning himself, seated on a fallen tree, with his
horse's bridle in his hand, three large wagons came toiling
along the intersecting roads; beside the foremost a
graceful girlish figure, tastefully attired in riding hat and
habit, and mounted upon a beautiful and spirited pony,
which she was managing with the utmost apparent ease
and skill; curbing its evident impatience to outstrip the
slower and more clumsily built animals attached to the
vehicles.</p>

<p>At sight of Kenneth, however, she loosened her hold
upon the rein, and came cantering briskly up with a gay
"Good-morning, Dr. Clendenin."</p>

<p>The face that met his gaze was so fair and winsome, so
bright with youthful animation, that the grave young
doctor could not forbear a smile as he returned her
greeting with courtly grace.</p>

<p>Nellie Lamar's beauty was of a very delicate type&mdash;a
sylph-like form, delicately moulded features, a sweet,
innocent expression, complexion of lilies and roses, a
profusion of pale golden hair, beautifully arched and
pencilled brows, large melting blue eyes, "deeply, darkly,
beautifully blue," and fringed with heavy silken lashes,
many shades darker than the hair.</p>

<p>She was but fifteen, just out of school and quite as
guileless and innocent as she looked.</p>

<p>A charming blush mantled her cheek as she caught the
admiring glance of Kenneth's eye.</p>

<p>"So, so, Fairy, be quiet, will you?" she said, tightening
her rein with one hand, while bending low over her
pony's neck she softly patted and stroked it with the
other. "If those clumsy, slow-moving creatures would
but travel faster!" she exclaimed with pretty petulance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
lifting her head again and sending an impatient glance
in the direction of the approaching wagons. "Neither
Fairy nor I can well brook having to keep pace with
them."</p>

<p>"They are somewhat more heavily laden than she," he
said smilingly, with some difficulty restraining the impetuosity
of his own steed, as he spoke; "she should have
charity for them. But I fear Romeo is disposed to join
her in leaving them behind. We will lead the van, however,
Miss Lamar, and sometimes indulge these restless
spirits in a run of a few miles ahead; if it is but to
return again."</p>

<p>"Ah, that will be delightful!" she cried with almost
childish vehemence. "I have fairly dreaded the thought
of travelling at this snail's pace all the way to Chillicothe."</p>

<p>The wagons had now come up, and from the foremost
peered out two chubby, rosy boy faces.</p>

<p>"O Doctor Clendenin! won't you take me up behind
you?" shouted the owner of one, the other chiming in,
"Me, too, doctor, me too!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Tom! hush, Billy! you should not ask such a
thing. Doctor, don't mind them," quickly interposed the
mother, showing her cheery, matronly face alongside of
theirs.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Nash," Kenneth said, moving to
the side of the wagon. "We have an auspicious day for
starting upon our long journey."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, doctor; and how thankful I am that
we're all well and so comfortably accommodated."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to care at all for the old home scenes
and friends we're leaving behind, Sarah," whined a
woman's voice from the second vehicle; "but for my
part I shall never, never forget them, and I think it's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
dreadfully hard I should have to go away from them all
into that howling wilderness, as one may say," and the
voice was lost in a burst of sobs.</p>

<p>"But we're going to our husbands, Nancy, and they
ought to be more to us than all the world beside," returned
Mrs. Nash, cheerfully. "Dear me, I'm just as
glad as can be to think that in a few weeks my Robert
and I will be together again for good and all."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the two, who were sisters-in-law,
the one always looking at the bright side of life, the other
at the dark; the one counting up her mercies, the other
her trials.</p>

<p>"It'll be a rough, hard journey, and some of us will be
sure to get sick," sighed Mrs. Barbour. "Flora's always
been a delicate child, and I'll never take her there alive."</p>

<p>"She's looking well," remarked Kenneth, glancing in
at the bright eyes and pink cheeks of a little girl, sitting
contentedly by Mrs. Barbour's side.</p>

<p>"And we'll have the doctor handy all the way, you
know," suggested Mrs. Nash. "Tom, Tom, be quiet,"
for the boy was still clamoring for a ride on Romeo.</p>

<p>"So you shall," Kenneth said, lifting him to the
coveted place, "and, Billy, you shall have your turn
another time."</p>

<p>The third wagon carried no passenger; its load consisting
of baggage, household stuff, a tent and provision
for the way, for there were few houses of entertainment
on the route and it would often be necessary to camp out
for the night.</p>

<p>The roads were new and rough; in many places in
very bad condition. Sometimes there was a mere bridle
path, and bushes and branches must be cut away, or
fallen trees removed, to allow the wagons to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
At noon of this first day they halted on the banks of a
bright little stream, dined upon such fare as they had
brought with them, and rested for an hour or two;
allowing their horses to graze and the children to disport
themselves in racing about through the underbrush in
search of wild flowers, in which Miss Nell presently
joined them.</p>

<p>Kenneth, leaving the two women sitting together on a
log, strolled away in another direction, toward Zeb and
the drivers who were keeping guard over the horses and
wagons.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" sighed Mrs. Barbour, "what a journey
we have before us! how we're ever to stand it I don't
know; I am tired already."</p>

<p>"Already!" echoed her sister; "why I don't intend
to be really tired for a week."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what intentions have to do with
it," returned the first speaker, rather angrily.</p>

<p>"A good deal, I assure you," asserted Mrs. Nash, with
decision. "Make up your mind to be miserable and you
can't fail to be so; resolve to enjoy yourself, and you're
almost equally sure to do that."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted her companion, turning away
with a scornful toss of the head.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked Miss Lamar, coming toward
them with her hands full of delicate spring blossoms.</p>

<p>"Wrong! where?" returned Mrs. Barbour, sharply,
thinking the query aimed at her.</p>

<p>"Yonder," Nell answered, gazing anxiously in the
direction of the group about the wagons; "they all seem
to be busying themselves about that wheel."</p>

<p>"There, I knew it!" cried Mrs. Barbour, "something's
broken, and we'll be kept here all night; and we'll be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
having such accidents all the way. Nobody ever was so
unfortunate as I am."</p>

<p>"Why you more than the rest of us?" asked her sister,
dryly. "If one is delayed, we all are."</p>

<p>"It was only a broken linchpin, already replaced by
another," announced Kenneth a few moments later;
"and now, if you please, ladies, we will go on our way
again."</p>

<p>At dusk the party arrived at a lonely log cabin in the
woods, where they found shelter for the night.</p>

<p>Fare and accommodations were none of the best&mdash;the
one consisting of fat pork, hominy, and coarse corn bread,
the other of hastily improvised beds, upon the floor of the
lower room for the women and children; upon that of
the loft overhead for the men.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbour, according to her wont, passed the time
previous to retiring in fretting and complaining; talking
of herself as the most ill-used and unfortunate of the
human race, though no one else in the company was
in any respect faring better than she, and all were not
only bearing their discomforts with patience and resignation,
but cheerfully and with an emotion of thankfulness
that they had a roof over their heads; as a heavy
rain storm had come on shortly after their arrival, and
continued till near morning.</p>

<p>But that was another of the complainer's grievances;
"The roads would be flooded, the streams so swollen
that it would be impossible to cross with the wagons."</p>

<p>Nell, hearing these doleful prognostications, turned an
anxious enquiring look upon Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed," he said, leaning toward her,
and speaking in an undertone of quiet assurance: "the
rain is much needed and therefore a cause for thankfulness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and if streams cannot be forded immediately, we
can encamp beside them and wait for the abating of the
waters."</p>

<p>"But our provisions may give out," she suggested.</p>

<p>"Then we will look for game in the woods, and fish
in the streams. No fear, little lady, that we shall not be
fed."</p>

<p>Nell liked the title, and felt it restful to lean upon one
who showed so much quiet confidence in&mdash;was it
his own powers and resources or something higher?</p>

<p>The journey was a tedious and trying one, occupying
several weeks; and Kenneth's office as leader of the
party was no sinecure.</p>

<p>There were many vexatious delays, some occasioned
by the wretched state of the roads, others incident to the
moving of the cumbrous and heavily laden wagons;
which latter might have been avoided had he travelled
alone, or in company with none but equestrians.</p>

<p>But Kenneth was of too noble and unselfish a nature
to grudge the cost of kindness to others.</p>

<p>And on him fell all the care and responsibility of
directing, controlling, and providing ways and means;
settling disputes among the drivers, and attending to
the safety and comfort of the women and children.</p>

<p>These various duties were performed with the utmost
fidelity, energy, and tact, and all annoyances borne with
unvarying patience and cheerfulness; even Mrs. Barbour's
peevish complainings and martyrlike airs failing
to move him out of his quiet self-possession, or goad him
into treating her with anything but the greatest courtesy
and kindness.</p>

<p>He showed the same to all in the little company, and
to those with whom they sought temporary lodgings here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
and there along the route; more especially to any who
were sick, exercising his skill as a physician for their
relief, and that without charge, though sometimes it
cost him the loss of a much needed night's rest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbour was too completely wrapped up in herself
and her own grievances, real or imaginary, to take
note of these things beyond a passing feeling of wonder
that Dr. Clendenin should bestow so much attention
upon people who were not likely ever to make him any
return; but ere the journey's end they had won for him
a very high place in the respect and esteem of the
other adults of the party, and in the hearts of the
children.</p>

<p>Nell, who was often sorely tried by these same vexations
and delays, formed an unbounded admiration for
Kenneth's powers of forbearance and self-control.</p>

<p>She gave expression to it in talking with Mrs. Nash,
as they found themselves alone for a few moments on
the evening previous to their arrival at their destination.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "I am astonished at his patience;
particularly with Nancy. She exasperates me beyond
everything&mdash;she is such a martyr. Yes, always, in all
places, and under all circumstances, she's a martyr."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_iii" id="chapter_iii">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Within five or six miles of Chillicothe an approaching
horseman was espied by our travellers, and, as he drew
near, Mrs. Nash and her two boys recognized him with a
simultaneous cry of delight.</p>

<p>"Robert!"</p>

<p>"Father, father!"</p>

<p>To which he responded with a glad "Hurrah! so
there you are at last!" as he put spurs to his horse and
came dashing up to the side of the wagon containing his
wife and children.</p>

<p>There was a halt of several minutes while joyous
greetings, and eager questions and answers were
exchanged; then leaving Mr. Nash in charge of the
slow-moving vehicles, Kenneth and Nellie rode on
toward the town.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of a perfect day in May. Their
path led them, now through the depths of a forest where
grew in abundance the sugar maple, black walnut, buckeye,
hackberry, cherry and other trees which give evidence
of a rich soil; now across a beautiful prairie
covered with grass from four to five feet high, and
spangled with loveliest wild flowers, which with the
blossoms of the plum tree, mulberry, crab apple and red
and black haw, fringing the outer edge of the prairies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
filled the air with delicious perfume, and feasted the eye
with beauty.</p>

<p>Nellie was in ecstasies. "It is a paradise, Dr. Clendenin!
is it not?" she cried.</p>

<p>"An earthly one," he answered with his grave kindly
smile. "May you find much happiness in it, little
lady."</p>

<p>"And you too, doctor," she said gaily, turning her
bright, winsome face to his. "I'm sure you ought."</p>

<p>"You think it a duty to be happy? and you are right."</p>

<p>"A duty? I never thought of it in that light," she
said laughing lightly.</p>

<p>"Ah! are we not bidden to be content with such
things as we have, and to be always rejoicing?"</p>

<p>They had become excellent friends&mdash;these two&mdash;as
day after day they rode side by side a little in advance
of the wagons.</p>

<p>There was some ten years difference in their ages, a
good deal seemingly at Nell's time of life. She looked
up to Kenneth as to one much older and wiser than herself,
and won by his ever ready sympathy and interest,
talked to him with the charming frankness of her confiding
nature and extreme youth. She told the history of
her past years, particularly the last five, which had
been spent in a boarding school in Philadelphia, and
about the brother she was going to:&mdash;how he fought
bravely for his country in the Continental army, had been
taken prisoner by the British, what he had suffered on
one of those dreadful prison-ships, till peace at last set
him free, that he had married since and now had a
family of children.</p>

<p>He was very much older than herself, she explained,
being the eldest born while she was the youngest, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
as both parents had died while she was a mere infant,
he was like a father to her. Kenneth seldom spoke of
himself, but she sometimes led him on by her questions
to talk of his home at Glen Forest, his mother and
Marian, for both of whom he evidently cherished a
deep and tender affection.</p>

<p>Nell remarked that she had seen them at church once
or twice, had thought Mrs. Clendenin very sweet and
noble looking, and Marian the loveliest of little girls.</p>

<p>"You read them both aright," was Kenneth's answer,
with a look and smile that made him, Nell thought, the
handsomest man she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"If he were not quite so old," she said to herself,
"perhaps, I don't know, but perhaps I might fall in
love with him. It would be very foolish though, for
of course he could never care for such a silly young
thing as I am."</p>

<p>She had observed that he seemed a skilful physician
and surgeon, and had discovered that he could
tell her a vast deal about trees and plants and the birds
and wild animals of the woods through which they
passed.</p>

<p>They had never met in Philadelphia though living
there at the same time, but it was pleasant to talk with
him about the city and its various attractions.</p>

<p>So they had not been at a loss for subjects of conversation,
nor were they to-day.</p>

<p>Silence fell between them for a few moments after
Kenneth's last remark, then Nell said, with a saucy
smile, "So you, I suppose, are never sad, Dr. Clendenin."</p>

<p>"Alas, Miss Lamar," he answered with a far away look
in his eyes, an expression of keen anguish sweeping
across his features, yet passing away so quickly that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
could hardly feel sure it had been there, "my theory and
practice do not always agree."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "I don't believe there is anybody
in the world who is not sad at times. Yet we have a
great deal to make us glad, and just now I feel as blithe
as a bird. We are coming to a river."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Scioto."</p>

<p>"Oh, then we must be near Chillicothe, are we
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here is the ferry, and yonder, on the farther
side, lies the town."</p>

<p>"That! I see only a few log cabins scattered here
and there in a dense forest."</p>

<p>"True, miss, that is just what it is," said the ferryman,
pushing off, for they were already on board his
flat boat; "but you'll find more houses than you'd
think, and the streets marked out quite straight and
wide."</p>

<p>"And can you tell me in which Major Lamar lives?"
Nell asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, miss, there are not so many of us that we
don't all know each other's faces, and houses too. The
major lives on Walnut Street, but a step from where I
shall land you. And yonder he comes," he added as
the boat touched the bank and Romeo and Fairy bounded
ashore.</p>

<p>Another moment and the girl was in her brother's
arms, weeping for very joy, as if her heart would break,
he soothing her with caresses and tender, loving words.</p>

<p>"There, there, Nell, darling, my sweet little sister,
we're together at last, and don't mean to be parted ever
again. Come, come, don't spoil your pretty eyes with
crying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
She brushed away her tears at that, raised her head,
saying, "O Percy, I'm so glad, so happy! How are
Clare and the children?"</p>

<p>Then without waiting for an answer, "Oh how
forgetful I am!" she cried turning to Kenneth, who
with half averted face and dewy eyes, was thinking of
Marian, and could almost feel the clinging of her arms
about his neck. "Percy, this is Dr. Clendenin, who has
cared for me like a brother, through all this long, tiresome
journey."</p>

<p>The two grasped each other's hands warmly, and the
major insisted on carrying Kenneth off with him to share
the hospitality of his house.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant home circle into which he was
presently introduced,&mdash;Mrs. Lamar, a fair, graceful,
bright-faced lady, still young, and three or four rosy,
bright-eyed boys and girls.</p>

<p>He received a warm welcome, while Nellie was
embraced, kissed and rejoiced over to her heart's content,
a heart that went out in strong affection to her
kindred and craved a full return.</p>

<p>The evening meal was already prepared, the table set
in the living room. Its snowy linen, delicate china
and shining silver would not have disgraced a much
more lordly dwelling; and the viands which presently
came in smoking from the kitchen, fresh fish, game and
hot corn-bread, might have tempted the appetite of an
epicure; much more that of our travellers, who had
fared but indifferently well for some days past.</p>

<p>The major's house was but a log cabin, the only kind
of building in the settlement at that time, simply furnished,
and consisted of only three rooms beside kitchen
and garret; yet a great deal of comfort and enjoyment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
were to be found there, and Kenneth was not ill-pleased
to be tendered the freedom of the house, and accepted
the offer with hearty thanks.</p>

<p>"We elect you our family physician, sir, if you will
not decline the office," said the major, as they rose from
the table; "and as such you will of course consider
yourself perfectly at home among us."</p>

<p>Kenneth was beginning to express his sense of his
host's kindness when he was interrupted by a hasty
summons to the bedside of a sick woman at the other
end of the village.</p>

<p>"Come, Nell, and take a look at Chillicothe," the
major said, leading the way to the grass plot in
front of the house, where they seated themselves upon a
log.</p>

<p>There were many such lying about the streets, many
trees and stumps of those which had been felled, still
standing; in fact nearly the whole town was still a
wilderness; yet though not a year old, it already contained,
beside private dwellings, two taverns and several
stores and shops of mechanics, but among them all
there were but four shingled houses, and on one the
shingles were fastened with pegs. The streets were
very wide and straight, crossing at right angles; not all
cleared yet, but marked out by blazing the trees of the
thick wood in whose midst the town was located.</p>

<p>There were many Indians in the vicinity. They had a
town not far away, on the north fork of Paint Creek, and
here in Chillicothe their wigwams were interspersed
among the dwellings of the whites as Nellie noticed
with some uneasiness.</p>

<p>But her brother reassured her. "There is no danger,"
he said, "they are perfectly friendly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
"Ah, but they are a treacherous race," she sighed
with a dubious shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Quite a change from Philadelphia, Nell," Clare
remarked, joining them with her knitting in her hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is many weeks since I left there."</p>

<p>"Is it nice in Philadelphia, Aunt Nellie?" asked
Bess, the eldest of the children, hanging affectionately
about the young girl. "Do tell us what it's like, and
about the pretty things in the shop windows."</p>

<p>"Another time, Bess," interposed the major. "Run
away to your play now, and let older people talk. Nell,
you saw Washington more than once?"</p>

<p>"Ah yes! many times&mdash;and he asked for you, Percy,
in the kindest way, speaking in the highest terms of
your services to the country."</p>

<p>"It is like him," the major exclaimed with emotion.</p>

<p>"And this young doctor, Nell," pursued Clare, with a
meaning smile, "what is he like?"</p>

<p>"Just what he has shown himself to-night," the girl
answered, blushing slightly, as she had a trick of doing,
the rich blood showing readily through the clear,
transparent skin.</p>

<p>"A handsome, polished, courteous gentleman, intelligent
and well informed above the generality, that is
about all one could learn in so short an interview," and
Clare laughed low and musically. "But you have had
an opportunity to study his character pretty thoroughly."</p>

<p>"A thing I never thought of doing," returned Nell,
with some annoyance; "but I can tell you that he is
very patient and very kind."</p>

<p>"Any one might well be that to you, Nell," remarked
her brother, regarding her with a proud, affectionate
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
"But it was not only to me, but to everybody, and to
the very horses and dogs. He seems to be always thinking
of others, never of himself, and to have a kind
look or word or smile for the humblest and meanest
creature that crosses his path, and," low and hesitatingly,
"I believe it's because he is a real, true Christian."</p>

<p>"I know it, one can read it in his face," said the major
heartily, "and I am rejoiced; for such men are needed
here."</p>

<p>"There they are!" cried Nell, starting up. "See! the
wagons are just crossing the ferry!"</p>

<p>The Nashes and Barbours had been old friends and
neighbors of the Lamars before the emigration of the
latter to Ohio, and the major and his wife now hurried to
meet and welcome them; Nell and the children following.</p>

<p>Kenneth, having bestowed all needed attention upon
his patient, was hurrying toward the ferry also, as
indeed was nearly every man and women in the village,
all alike rejoicing in every new accession to their numbers,
and eager for news from the older settlements.</p>

<p>There were joyous greetings, hearty handshakings, and
quite a crowd gathered around Kenneth, giving him welcome,
expressing unfeigned satisfaction with the advent
among them of a good physician.</p>

<p>"Why, hollo! I recognize an old friend! Kenneth
Clenendin, I was never more surprised and delighted in
my life!" cried a familiar voice, and our hero's hand was
warmly grasped in that of a former schoolmate, a young
man of pleasing, open countenance, and bluff, hearty
manner.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Godfrey Dale?" Kenneth exclaimed, shaking
the hand cordially, his face lighting up with pleasure.
"Why, where did you come from?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
"From Tiffen's tavern over yonder, the sign of the
General Anthony Wayne," returned Dale, laughing.</p>

<p>"You are here as a settler?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and as land agent and lawyer. It's a fine
country, Kenneth, and men of both your profession and
mine are needed in it. Come, let me show you my quarters.
You must share them for the present, at all events."</p>

<p>And linking his arm in that of his friend, he led the
way, nearly all the men of the crowd following.</p>

<p>The General Anthony Wayne was no spacious modern
hotel, but like its neighbors a log building with windows
of greased paper, its accommodations of the plainest.</p>

<p>A cheerful wood fire blazed in its wide chimney, but
the evening was a warm one for the time of year, and the
company preferred the outer air.</p>

<p>They grouped themselves about the door, sitting on
stumps and logs, or leaning against the trees, while Kenneth,
the centre of the throng, patiently answered questions
and gave all the information in his power regarding
matters of public interest both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>The sun went down behind the hill overlooking the
valley on the west, the stars shone from a clear sky overhead,
and lights twinkled here and there among the trees.</p>

<p>Nell, standing in the doorway of her brother's house,
asked what they were, remarking:</p>

<p>"They are many more in number than the cabins."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Clare, "do you not know that the
Indians have a way of lighting up their wigwams with
torches made of the splinters of birch and pine?"</p>

<p>"I wish," murmured the girl, with a slight shudder,
"that they could be kept away&mdash;miles away from the
town."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_iv" id="chapter_iv">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Early hours were the rule among the settlers in those
primitive days, and by nine o'clock all was darkness and
silence in the dwelling of the Lamars.</p>

<p>A bed stood in one corner of the large family room, a
trundle bed beneath it, which was drawn out at night;
and here slept the parents and younger children.</p>

<p>One of two smaller apartments between this and the
kitchen was appropriated to Nell; the other occupied by
the older children.</p>

<p>The young girl was roused from her sleep in the middle
of the night by something falling down the wall close to
her side.</p>

<p>"Percy! Percy!" she screamed in affright.</p>

<p>"What is it, Nell?" answered the major, springing out
of bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, I don't know! It's too dark to see!
But, oh, come and bring a light quickly!"</p>

<p>That was more easily said than done; friction matches
were as yet an unknown luxury; the choice was between
flint and steel and the fire covered upon the kitchen
hearth.</p>

<p>He chose the latter, but it was a work of time to hunt
out a coal from the ashes, and blow it into life till it
would ignite the wick of a candle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
The thing was accomplished at last, however, and the
light revealed a viper beneath Nell's bed.</p>

<p>The major succeeded in killing it, and soothing his
sister's alarm with a few kindly reassuring words, again
retired to rest.</p>

<p>It was some time before Nell's fears were forgotten in
sleep, and a grumbling voice from the kitchen woke her
early in the morning.</p>

<p>"Dear me, who's been rakin' ober dis fire? It's clar
out, every spark of it; an', Tig, you'll have to run over
nex' do' for a bran' to start it wid."</p>

<p>Silvy the cook was evidently very much out of humor.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! you didn't cober it up right," returned the
boy.</p>

<p>"You git along!" was the wrathful answer. "I
reckon you done raked it ober yourself; and I'll tell de
major ef you don' quit cuttin' up sech shines. Be off
after dat bran' now, fast as you kin go."</p>

<p>Nell turned over on her pillow and listened.</p>

<p>"Percy must have forgotten to cover up the coals
again," she said to herself. "What a narrow escape I
had! What with Indians and vipers in the town, bears,
wolves and panthers in the woods, I seem to have come
into a dangerous place."</p>

<p>She sighed rather drearily, a homesick feeling
creeping over her, spite of her love for Percy and the
rest.</p>

<p>But that presently vanished before the beauty of a
balmy, sunshiny May morning, the sight of the well-spread
breakfast table, and the affectionate greetings of
her brother and the children.</p>

<p>"I'm going shopping, Nell," announced Mrs. Lamar
two hours later, when the house had been set to rights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and Silvy given her orders for the day; "will you go
with me?"</p>

<p>"Shopping!" echoed the young girl in incredulous
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes; do you think Philadelphia is the only place
where one may shop?"</p>

<p>"No; but here in the woods?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here in the woods we can shop; we have
already three stores."</p>

<p>So they donned their bonnets and sallied forth.</p>

<p>It was pleasant walking in the shade of the great
forest trees, traversing at the same time woodland paths
and village streets, the twitter of birds and rustling
of leaves in the breeze mingling with the busy hum of
human voices and the sound of the woodman's axe; for
men were engaged here and there in laying the foundations
for new dwellings or clearing spaces preparatory
to doing so.</p>

<p>Not many rods from the General Anthony Wayne
they came upon Dr. Clendenin and his friend Godfrey
Dale, standing together in earnest conversation, while
some workmen stood near apparently awaiting their
directions.</p>

<p>The gentlemen lifted their hats, Kenneth with the
grave, quiet smile Nell had learned to know so well,
Godfrey saying "A pleasant morning, ladies."</p>

<p>"Are you going to build?" asked Mrs. Lamar, nodding
in return.</p>

<p>"Yes; a double office with a hall between," said
Dale. "We think it will be sociable."</p>

<p>A man came staggering up axe in hand. "I&mdash;I'm after&mdash;a
job; and you&mdash;you wa&mdash;want these trees cut
down?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
"We do, Davis, but you're in no condition to wield
an axe at present," returned Dale; and growling out an
oath the fellow staggered away.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly dreadful the amount of drunkenness we
have here of late!" remarked Mrs. Lamar looking after
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, whiskey's too cheap," said Dale; "men, women
and children are getting drunk."</p>

<p>"How is that?" enquired Kenneth, "there is no distillery
in the vicinity?"</p>

<p>"No; but since keel boats have begun to run on the
Scioto the Monongahela whiskey manufacturers have
rushed their firewater in here in such quantities that the
cabins are crowded with it and it has fallen in price to
fifty cents a gallon."</p>

<p>"They'll be making work for you, doctor," said
Mrs. Lamar, "and I hope you'll try to convince the
people that whiskey taken in such quantities is ruinous
to health."</p>

<p>"Ruinous to body and soul," he said. "You may rest
assured, Mrs. Lamar, that my influence will be decidedly
against its use."</p>

<p>"We will take a stroll round the town, Nell, before
making our purchases," Clare said, moving on. "What a
grave, quiet manner Dr. Clendenin has, for so young a
man!"</p>

<p>It was a new phase of life now presenting itself to the
young girl, and she found it interesting. Her attention
was presently attracted by a squaw walking a little distance
ahead of them, wearing a shawl completely covered
with silver brooches.</p>

<p>"They get them at Detroit in exchange for furs,
moccasins and baskets," explained Clare. "You know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
I suppose, that they are quite skilled in ornamental work
with beads and porcupine quills."</p>

<p>The major joined them and they extended their
walk for a mile or more through the woods, climbing the
hill that forms the western boundary of the valley, from
which they had a birdseye view of the village and the
surrounding country, a beautiful landscape, in all its
native wildness, diversified with hill and valley, forest
and prairie, traversed by streams of living water.</p>

<p>Returning, they called upon Mrs. Nash, whom they
found in excellent spirits, full of enthusiastic delight with
her new home and her restoration to the companionship
of her husband, after months of separation. That
seemed to make amends for everything: accustomed
comforts could be done without, inconveniences easily
borne, they would soon be remedied, and in the meantime
were mere subjects for mirth.</p>

<p>"She's a cheery and wise little woman," was the
major's remark, as they went on their way again.</p>

<p>"Yes; always the same," assented his wife; "but
we'll hear a different story here," as they approached
another cabin. "This is where the Barbours live, Nell,
and I know Nancy of old."</p>

<p>"So do I, and we part company here," said the major
laughingly, lifting his hat to his wife and sister, and
hurrying on his way, while they drew near the open
door of the dwelling.</p>

<p>"Walk in, ladies," said Mr. Barbour, putting his little
girl off his knee, and trying to give them seats.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said his wife, coming forward. "I
was just wondering if you two were going to be formal
with an old friend like me. How fortunate you are in
being able to run about enjoying yourselves, while here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
I've been hard at work since daylight; no time to rest
after my long journey, but I must go to work washing
up our dirty clothes the first thing."</p>

<p>"No, now, Nancy," expostulated her husband, "you
needn't have done it. I told you there were camp-women
about, from Wayne's army, that would be glad of the
job."</p>

<p>"And I wouldn't have one of them near me if I never
have any help," she retorted; "but I never get any thanks
from you, work as hard as I will."</p>

<p>"Father's been at work too," put in Flora, leaning up
affectionately against him; "and so have I, and we've
got most everything fixed now."</p>

<p>"Yes, you look quite settled already," Mrs. Lamar
remarked, glancing round the room.</p>

<p>"It needn't take long for that when you've but one
room and next to nothing to put in it," whined Mrs. Barbour.
"But perhaps it's just as well not to have much, or
it might be stolen from you; for I dare say those camp-women
and soldiers are thievish; and I don't suppose
there's any sort of government here yet, to protect
property."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of anything being stolen here," said
Mrs. Lamar; "though to be sure the town is not a year
old yet."</p>

<p>"Well, there was a suspicious looking woman prowling
about here last night; she came in making an excuse
that she wanted to light her pipe at the fire, and stared
round as if she was taking note where things were, in
case she should get a chance to help herself."</p>

<p>"Pooh! only idle curiosity," said Mr. Barbour.
"You're always meeting trouble more than half way,
Nancy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
"We're out shopping," remarked Nell, willing to change
the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>"Shopping!" echoed Mrs. Barbour with a derisive
laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Lamar, rising; "and that reminds
me, Nell, that we should be attending to it at once."</p>

<p>It was no very arduous undertaking; in the first
store they entered they were promptly supplied with the
darning needle and skein of thread they were in search
of. Change was made in a novel way; literally made by
cutting a silver dollar into halves, quarters and eighths.</p>

<p>The merchant, an unmarried man, was extremely polite
and courteous, and while waiting upon the ladies cast
many a furtive, admiring glance at the slight, graceful
figure and fair face of the major's young sister.</p>

<p>Kenneth had a call that afternoon to a case of delirium
tremens, which took him past the dwelling of the Barbours.</p>

<p>He knew they were not in, having seen them but a few
moments before strolling in the opposite direction, and
was therefore surprised, within a few yards of the
cabin, to see a man issue from the back door, with a
bundle under his arm, and disappear among the trees.</p>

<p>The doctor paused for an instant, with the thought of
giving pursuit, but the call for his services was urgent,
and he hurried on again.</p>

<p>Turning a corner the next moment he came suddenly
upon a man and woman conversing together in low tones,
who at sight of him shrank guiltily back into the shadow
of the trees; but not before his quick eye had caught a
sight of their faces in the gathering gloom, for twilight
had already set in, and his ear a few words of their talk.</p>

<p>"A pretty good haul considering."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
"Yes; and now we'd best be off."</p>

<p>Suspicious words enough, but Kenneth had no time
to think of them then, nor for hours afterward&mdash;so critical
was the condition of his patient. It was only when
on returning about sunrise the next morning, they were
recalled to his mind by the sound of Mrs. Barbour's
voice lifted up in scolding and lamentation.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're gone, every one of them;&mdash;that overcoat,
just as good as new, the shirt I finished only the day
before I started from home, and that elegant bandanna
handkerchief. I told you somebody would get in and
rob us in our sleep, if you didn't fasten the door well.
Perhaps you'll believe another time that my opinion's
worth something."</p>

<p>"There, there, Nancy, don't go on as if everything we
had was lost. The town isn't so large that a thief can
keep himself hid very long in it," Mr. Barbour was replying
as the doctor stepped up to the open door.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said, "I accidentally overheard
Mrs. Barbour's lament, in passing, and I think I can
throw some light on this matter," then went on to tell of
what he had seen and heard the previous evening.</p>

<p>"So you see, Nancy, we weren't robbed in our sleep
after all," was Mr. Barbour's comment, addressed to his
wife.</p>

<p>"No thanks to you, anyhow," she retorted; "and it's
your fault all the same; because I wouldn't have gone
out and left the house alone if I'd had my way."</p>

<p>Mr. Barbour subsided. Why could he not learn how
utterly useless it was to attempt to justify himself under
the accusations of his wife?</p>

<p>"And there you sit never moving hand or foot to find
the thief and get your own out of his clutches!" she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
whined, moving about with disconsolate and martyrlike
air at her work of preparing the morning meal.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I'll go and see what can be done," he
said, rising and putting on his hat. "Doctor, would
you recognize the thief?"</p>

<p>"I am quite sure I should know again the suspicious
looking persons I have been telling you of," Kenneth
answered as they stepped out together.</p>

<p>"Now don't be gone all day, Mr. Barbour; breakfast
will be on the table in half an hour," his wife called after
him.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said looking back, "am I to let the
thief escape rather than keep you waiting for an
hour?"</p>

<p>"Of course you'll do one or the other&mdash;probably both,"
she fretted, as he walked on without waiting for an
answer, "though it needn't take half that time to scour
this wretched little town from end to end."</p>

<p>It did not; scarcely ten minutes had elapsed before it
was known by every inhabitant that a theft had been
committed, and that a man named Brannon and his wife,
people of low character, whose absence would be gain to
the place, had absconded during the night. They were
not desirable citizens, but the stolen property must be
recovered, and the larceny punished.</p>

<p>A hot pursuit was immediately begun, and before
noon the culprits were taken and brought back in
triumph.</p>

<p>But as yet the town had no constituted authorities.
What was to be done?</p>

<p>The citizens gathered together on the river bank, chose
one of their number, a Mr. Samuel Smith, as judge, and
proceeded to try Brannon in due form; a jury was empanelled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the judge appointed Godfrey Dale as attorney
for the prosecution, and another young lawyer,
Maurice Gerard by name, for the defence.</p>

<p>Witnesses were called and examined. The goods had
been found in possession of the accused, but he stoutly
affirmed that they were his own.</p>

<p>Barbour, however, was able to prove property, and Dr.
Clendenin's evidence was strong against the prisoner,
whom he identified without hesitation as the man he had
seen carrying away a bundle from Barbour's cabin the
previous evening.</p>

<p>There was other testimony, but Kenneth's was the
most conclusive.</p>

<p>The judge summed up the evidence, the jury retired
to a short distance, and in a few moments returned
with the verdict of guilty, and that the culprit be sentenced
according to the discretion of the judge.</p>

<p>The latter presently announced his decision:&mdash;ten
lashes upon the naked back of the prisoner, or that he
should sit upon a bare pack-saddle on his pony, while
his wife taking it by the bridle should lead it through
every street of the village, pausing before the door of
each house with the announcement, "This is Brannon
who stole the great-coat, handkerchief, and shirt."</p>

<p>Brannon chose the latter horn of the dilemma, and a
responsible person was appointed by the judge to see the
sentence immediately and faithfully executed.</p>

<p>The crowd waited to see the man mounted upon the
pony, then scattered to their homes or other positions
favorable for watching his progress through the
town.</p>

<p>He submitted to his punishment in dogged silence:
glancing about him with an air of sullen defiance as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
took his seat. Then his eye caught that of Kenneth
fixed upon him in grave pity, and the look was returned
with one of bitter hatred and revenge.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" he muttered under his breath, "the
day will come when you'll repent of this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_v" id="chapter_v">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The Brannons fled immediately upon being released,
after the carrying out of the sentence. No one mourned
their departure: but Nell Lamar, having heard from
Dale of the look the culprit had cast upon Kenneth,
rejoiced not a little in secret that they were gone.</p>

<p>"Dr. Clendenin had been so kind to her on her journey,"
she explained to herself, "that in common gratitude
she must care for his safety."</p>

<p>Naturally, being both friend and physician to the
major's family, Kenneth was a frequent visitor at their
house. Though noticeably quiet and undemonstrative
in manner, he soon became a great favorite with them all,
from the parents down to the youngest child; and Nell
saw no reason to appropriate his visits to herself, even
when unprofessional.</p>

<p>Nor had she any desire to do so; and in fact his conversation
was seldom directed to her. Yet it did not
escape Clare's quick observation that the calm gray eye
saw every movement of her young sister, and that no
tone of the sweet girlish voice ever fell unheeded upon
his ear.</p>

<p>She was well pleased, Nell could not help loving
such a man, or being happy with him, so would soon be
provided for, and the major relieved of her support.</p>

<p>That last would never have been the major's thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
his darling little sister was esteemed no burden by him.
He was one of the wealthiest men in the place, held a
highly responsible office under the general government,
and had received large grants of land in compensation
for his services in the Revolutionary war.</p>

<p>Nell was fond of her brother, yet stood somewhat in
awe of him. He was a reserved, rather taciturn man,
and military life had increased a natural tendency to
sternness of manner toward those under his authority
which belied his real kindness of heart. He had never a
harsh word or look for Nell, yet she dared not lavish
upon him the demonstrations of affection her loving
young heart longed to bestow; dared not offer him a
caress; and he rarely gave them unasked to her or to any
one else except the youngest of his children.</p>

<p>Clare was more demonstrative and really meant to be
very kind, but was as dictatorial and domineering in her
way as the major in his, and before many days had passed
she began to treat the young girl as a child, checking,
criticising, reproving, and directing with the most exasperating
persistency, and as having an undoubted right.</p>

<p>This was very trying to Nell's sense of womanly
dignity; and though by no means an ill-tempered little
body, she sometimes found it difficult to possess her soul
in patience.</p>

<p>"Where now?" asked Clare one morning, addressing
her.</p>

<p>"To the woods with the children, after wild flowers
and mosses," returned the young girl gaily.</p>

<p>She was standing in the doorway swinging a broad-brimmed
hat by its strings, her beautiful uncovered hair
glittering like burnished gold in the sunbeams sifting
down upon it through the leaves of the overshadowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
trees, as they stirred restlessly to and fro in the pleasant
summer breeze.</p>

<p>She was in a happy mood, light-hearted and free from
care as the birds warbling overhead, and had been
humming snatches of song till interrupted by Clare's
question.</p>

<p>"You have been here nearly a week now," pursued
that lady in precisely the tone she would have used to
one of her children, "don't you think it is time to begin
to make yourself useful? Life was never meant for a
perpetual holiday."</p>

<p>Nell's cheek crimsoned.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do? offer my services as
assistant to Silvy the cook, Maria the nurse-maid, or
Tig the stable boy?" she asked in a slightly sarcastic
tone.</p>

<p>"Silvy is an excellent cook, and it might not be at all
amiss for you to take some lessons of her," said Clare.
"But there are other employments. The children need
instruction, and you ought to be able to give it. Then
there are spinning and sewing."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about spinning."</p>

<p>"I'll teach you, in return for the lessons you give the
children in spelling, reading and writing."</p>

<p>"Very well, we'll talk of it when I come back from my
walk," Nell answered, tying on her hat.</p>

<p>She was willing enough to make herself useful, but
Clare's manner was irritating.</p>

<p>Her annoyance was, however, soon forgotten in the
prattle of the children, and the beauty of the woods.</p>

<p>They wandered about till weary, then sat down on a
log to rest.</p>

<p>"Now if I only had a book," remarked Nell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
"Why didn't you bring one?" asked Bess.</p>

<p>"I don't mean a Sunday book, such as those on the
shelves in the sitting-room," was the half scornful reply.</p>

<p>"Aunt Nell, there are some other kinds of books up
in the garret."</p>

<p>"What kinds?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; stories, I believe, but not fit for
me to read, mother says."</p>

<p>Nell rose eagerly. "Come, let us go back," she said,
"I must see those books. But how came they there?"</p>

<p>Bess explained as they wended their homeward way,
she walking soberly by her aunt's side, the boys racing
on before, climbing and jumping over stumps and logs.</p>

<p>The major had formerly been in the mercantile business,
and in the garret were stowed away boxes of goods&mdash;a
medley of many odds and ends which had fallen to
his share in the division of unsold stock made by himself
and partner in the winding up of the joint concern.</p>

<p>The garret was the favorite resort of the children when
kept within doors by stormy weather, and Bess had made
herself well acquainted with the contents of the boxes,
turning them over and over in search of "pretty things"
with which to bedeck her dolls and herself.</p>

<p>The books proved to be novels&mdash;"Claremont" complete
in several volumes and an odd volume of "Peregrine
Pickle."</p>

<p>Nell seized upon them with delight and carried them
off to her bed-room. Books were rare luxuries in those
days, there were no newspapers or magazines published
in that region of country, and as yet there was no regular
mail.</p>

<p>Nell read and re-read "Claremont," devoting to its
perusal every spare moment when she could steal away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
unobserved to the solitude of her room, and carrying a
volume with her in her rambles with the children.</p>

<p>Then she took up "Peregrine Pickle," but with sore
disappointment that the first volume was missing; so
much so that she at length plucked up courage to ask her
brother what had become of it; though quite fearful
that he would disapprove of her reading it.</p>

<p>"Well," he said with a smile, "I suppose my former
partner has it, and somebody is probably as anxious for
this as you are for it. I'm sorry, for your sake, that we
were so careless in dividing our stock."</p>

<p>"It is just as well," said Clare; "time can be more
profitably employed than in the reading of such trash."</p>

<p>"I consider it a very innocent amusement," replied the
major, shortly; not over-pleased with the remark, seeing
that it called a flush of wounded feeling to Nellie's fair
cheek. "I remember that I enjoyed reading it myself. If
it were in my power to get it for you, Nell, you should
have it."</p>

<p>She thanked him with a look, then rose and left the
room.</p>

<p>"This is but a dull place for her after Philadelphia,"
he said to his wife. "I have no doubt she misses the
weekly newspaper and many another source of entertainment
which she enjoyed there, but must do without here."</p>

<p>"Probably; but she is no worse off in regard to those
things than any of the rest of us," said Clare coolly.</p>

<p>"You forget, my dear, that you have me," returned
the major with playful pleasantry. "And the children,"
he added, taking his youngest on his knee. "We're
worth a good deal, aren't we, Ralph?"</p>

<p>The major so sincerely regretted his sister's disappointment
that it was frequently in his thoughts during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
next week, and he was seriously considering the feasibility
of sending to Philadelphia or New York for a box of
books such as she would find both entertaining and
instructive, when the want was supplied in an unlooked
for manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Clendenin and his friend Dale had pushed forward
their office building as fast as possible and taken
possession.</p>

<p>Making a call upon Kenneth one afternoon, the major
found him unpacking books and arranging them upon
shelves he had had put up along the wall.</p>

<p>"Books!" cried the major. "You have quite a
library. All medical works?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Kenneth. "Will you step up and look
at them? My stock is not large, but valuable, to me at
least, and I hope to add to it from time to time."</p>

<p>"Valuable! yes, indeed, to a lover of literature,"
remarked the major running his eye over the titles.
"Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Dryden, Gray, Goldsmith,
Gibbon, Plutarch, Rollins, etc., etc. Poetry, history,
fiction are well represented, and I see you have a goodly
supply of religious works of the best class, also. Medical
books, too, in plenty, but of their quality I am no judge."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall not want for good companionship here
in my somewhat rough bachelor quarters," Kenneth
answered, surveying his treasures with an air of quiet
content. "But I do not mean to be selfish, major, make
yourself at home among my friends."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned the major heartily, wishing
that Nell had been included in the invitation; when
Kenneth, as if in answer to his thoughts, said, "The
ladies of your family, too, might find something here to
enjoy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Then the major told of Nell's disappointment, and half
an hour later was on his way home, carrying her the
"Vicar of Wakefield," and the assurance that Dr. Clendenin's
entire library was at her service.</p>

<p>Nell's face sparkled with delight at the news, and the
sight of the book.</p>

<p>"How kind in him!" she said. "I'll handle them with
the greatest care."</p>

<p>For many months those books and the talks with their
owner which naturally grew out of their perusal, were her
greatest enjoyment; for as yet she had very few companions
near her own age.</p>

<p>But as the town grew there was a corresponding increase
in its young society and in the sources of amusement
and entertainment open to her. She had many
admirers and Kenneth stepped quietly aside, as one who
had no desire to win the prize.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamar did not understand it, no more did Dale,
or Nell herself, though Kenneth had never comported
himself as a lover and she had not consciously thought
of him.</p>

<p>There were other things about Kenneth that puzzled
Dale. He seemed to have some secret grief; there were
times when his look and manner betokened inexpressible
sadness, though he always shook it off and assumed an
air of cheerfulness on being spoken to.</p>

<p>Dale's curiosity was piqued, and indeed he would have
rejoiced to give all the sympathy and comfort that might
be in his power; but there was a quiet, reserved dignity
about Kenneth that forbade any intrusion into his private
affairs.</p>

<p>He rarely spoke of himself or his own concerns; he
sometimes mentioned his mother or sister, always with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the greatest respect and affection, but his talk when
they were alone together was of literature, of the interests
of the community in which they lived, the state, the
country, the acts of the government, and what was going
on in foreign lands, or of Dale's own plans and prospects,
in which Kenneth took the most generous, unselfish
interest.</p>

<p>As a physician he was untiring in his efforts to relieve,
patient and sympathizing, in manner gentle even to tenderness
with the aged and with the little ones.</p>

<p>He soon came to have great influence in the community
and it was always cast on the side of right. A man
of pure morals and an earnest Christian, he was as ready
and competent to pray with the sick and dying, and to
point out to the troubled soul the paths of peace, as any
minister could be.</p>

<p>These offices were performed as simply and easily as
those others in which the healing of the body only was
concerned.</p>

<p>Another thing Dale noticed, with the thought that it
was decidedly odd, that Kenneth took evident pains to
make acquaintance with all the Indians in the vicinity,
and of every white man who had visited their tribes,
whether near or far off, or had had much to do with
them in any way: that he asked many questions, wording
each with care to avoid arousing suspicion in regard to
his motives, and that invariably his main object seemed
to be to gain information in regard to whites living
among the Indians.</p>

<p>Once Dale ventured to ask if he had ever had a friend or
relative carried off by them; but the answer was a quiet
"No," that while it left his curiosity entirely unsatisfied,
gave no encouragement to further questioning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
They were in Dale's office; Kenneth had come across
the connecting hall with some enquiry in regard to a
piece of land for the disposal of which Dale was the
agent, and a casual mention of the Indians had made a
favorable opening for his query.</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed Kenneth's reply, then Zeb
came rushing in.</p>

<p>"Somefin goin' on down to de rivah, sahs, Squire
Smith goin' for to hol' court, dey say. Sent de constable
to cotch the tief an' fotch him along double quick."</p>

<p>Dale sprang from his chair and caught up his hat.</p>

<p>"My services may be needed," he said, laughing,
"though the squire doesn't make much account of law.
Come on, doc; if the sentence should be flogging you
may be needed too."</p>

<p>A man named Adam McMurdy, who cultivated some
land on the station prairie below the town, had come in
to Squire Smith with a complaint that during his absence
the previous night, some one had stolen his horse collar;
that he had examined the collars on the horses of the
ploughmen at work this morning, recognized one of them
as his, and claimed it of the horse's owner, Bill Slack.</p>

<p>That Slack had not only refused to restore it, insisting
that it was his own, but used very abusive language
toward him (McMurdy), and threatened to whip him for
accusing him of the theft.</p>

<p>On hearing the story the squire immediately despatched
his constable in search of Slack, with strict orders to
bring him and the collar at once into court.</p>

<p>The court had already convened under the trees by the
river side, and the constable was hurrying toward it with
the collar in one hand, the accused tightly grasped in the
other, as Dr. Clendenin and Dale stepped into the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
They followed quickly on the heels of the constable. Life
had so little of the spice of variety then and there
that even so trivial an affair created some stir and excitement.</p>

<p>Also the squire had an amusing method of dealing out
justice that made a trial conducted by him somewhat
entertaining to those who were spectators.</p>

<p>Nearly all the men of the town were there.</p>

<p>The prisoner being arraigned at the bar of justice, the
squire turned to McMurdy and asked, "How can you
prove this collar to be yours?"</p>

<p>"If the collar is mine," he replied, "Mr. Spear, who is
present, can testify."</p>

<p>Mr. Spear, the Presbyterian minister, stepped forward.</p>

<p>"If the collar is McMurdy's," he said, "I wrote his
name on it, on the inner side of the ear."</p>

<p>"Hand it to me," said the squire. Taking it from the
constable and turning up the ear, "Yes, here's the
name. No better proof could be given, and my sentence
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If the court will excuse the interruption," began
Dale, a mischievous twinkle in his eye; "let me say
that according to law, as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, the court won't be interrupted," returned the
squire, frowning him down. "All laws were intended
for the purpose of enforcing justice. I know what's right
and what's wrong as well as the man that made the laws;
therefore stand in no need of laws to govern my actions.</p>

<p>"My sentence is that the prisoner be tied up forthwith
to your buckeye and receive five lashes well laid on."</p>

<p>It was done and the crowd dispersed. The trial had
occupied scarcely five minutes and every one was satisfied
except the culprit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_vi" id="chapter_vi">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>"There's even-handed justice for ye, stranger?"</p>

<p>A stalwart backwoodsman in hunting garb of dressed
skins was the speaker, and the words were addressed to
Kenneth, near to whom he had stood during the brief
trial of Bill Slack.</p>

<p>Dale had walked away in company with a brother lawyer,
and Kenneth was turning from the unpleasant scene
with a thought of pity for the weakness and wickedness
of the unhappy criminal.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "Squire Smith is a man of discriminating
mind and judgment, very impartial in his
decisions, and prompt in seeing them carried out. But
what a happy world this might be if all were honest and
upright!"</p>

<p>"That's true; but we've got to take it as it is.</p>

<p>"Got quite a town here," pursued the hunter, moving
along by Kenneth's side as he walked up the street.
"Last time I was round here in these parts, there wasn't
so much as an Injun wigwam to be seen; nothin' but the
thickest kind o' thick woods."</p>

<p>"I thought your face was quite new to me," said Kenneth.
"May I ask where you are from?"</p>

<p>"You kin ask, sir, and I haven't the least objection in
life to tellin'. I've been huntin' and trappin' all through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
this Northwestern Territory, along the Ohio and the
Little Miami, and away up north by the great lakes; and
even as far as the head waters of the Mississippi. And I
come back with a lot of furs and skins. Sold 'em mostly
in Detroit."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Kenneth, with interest. "You
must have had an adventurous life, and fallen in with
many tribes of Indians."</p>

<p>"Humph! yes, young man; saw a good deal more of
the ugly, treacherous varmints than I cared to. I hain't
no love for 'em, and no more have they for me."</p>

<p>"You have had some encounters with them?"</p>

<p>"More'n a few, stranger. I've taken their scalps, and
been mighty near losin' my own; have been in their
clutches several times, run the gauntlet twice, and would
have been burnt at the stake if I hadn't made my escape.
However, I haven't any more to tell than any other man
that's been huntin' and trappin' for ten or a dozen years."</p>

<p>Kenneth invited him into his office, set food and drink
before him, and by dint of adroit questioning drew from
him a good deal of information in regard to the various
tribes among whom he had been.</p>

<p>"Have you ever met with any whites living with them?"
he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Yes, occasionally. There's Simon Gerty; I saw him,
and he's a worse savage than the redskins."</p>

<p>"But any others? Any women?"</p>

<p>"I met another man that was a prisoner, got away
afterwards; and saw children at different times, girls
and boys, both, that they'd stole away from their folks
and adopted. And I saw a white woman a few weeks
ago, that's been with 'em for years, and is married to an
Injun; got a family of pappooses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
In reply to further questions he went on to describe
the situation of the Indian village where he had seen this
woman, but could give no description of her, except that
she was very much tanned, dressed like the squaws, and
had scarcely a more civilized look than they.</p>

<p>"I hope she's no kin o' yours?" he remarked, looking
keenly at his questioner.</p>

<p>"No; I never had friend or relative taken by them,"
Kenneth answered, "though our family were pioneers,
and several of them lost their lives by the Indians."</p>

<p>"Humph! then I reckon you hain't no love for 'em
either?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as I ought to have, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"How's that? Can't say as I see any call to love 'em
at all."</p>

<p>"They are human creatures, and Christ died for them
as well as for the white man. Doubtless they are equally
dear to Him," Kenneth answered, with gentle gravity,
fixing a kindly look upon his rough companion.</p>

<p>"Well, now, that may be," the man returned thoughtfully.
"Fact is, I've never paid much attention to those
things. Minister, are ye?"</p>

<p>"No; a doctor."</p>

<p>"Find much to do about here?"</p>

<p>"Not just now," Kenneth answered aloud, adding to
himself, "Happily I can very well be spared for a few
days."</p>

<p>Upon the departure of the backwoodsman from the
office, Zeb was summoned and directed to saddle Romeo
and have him at the door by the time his master should
return from a round of visits among his town patients.</p>

<p>"I am going off on a hunt, Zeb, and shall want my
gun, blanket and some provisions; get me some parched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
corn, bread and a little salt, and pack them in one end of
my saddle-bags," was his final order.</p>

<p>"Yes, sah. You'll take me 'long, I s'pose?" interrogatively.</p>

<p>"No, Zeb, I'm going alone; I must leave you to take
care of the office and see who calls. I shall be away for
two or three days, or longer, and shall want to know when
I return who have been wanting the doctor, that I may
go to them at once."</p>

<p>"'Tain't jes' the very bestest time ob yeah for a hunt,"
muttered the boy, watching his master as he strode rapidly
down the street. "Wondah what sort ob game
Massa Doctah's gwine arter."</p>

<p>By noon of that day Kenneth had put several miles of
hill and valley between him and Chillicothe.</p>

<p>He had gone, telling no one whither, or on what errand
he was bound, and those who saw him leaving the town
took it for granted that he had had a call to some sick
person in the country.</p>

<p>His course was northwesterly, and for days he pressed
on sturdily in that direction, taking an hour's rest at noon,
subsisting on the provisions in his saddle-bags, and such
small game as came in his way, at night kindling a fire
to keep off the wild beasts, and sleeping on the ground,
wrapped in his blanket, with his horse picketed near by.</p>

<p>His way lay through pathless forests and over trackless
prairies where perhaps the foot of white man had
never trod; the solitude was utter and the compass his
only guide; not a human creature did he meet; but
during the hours of darkness his ears were greeted with
the cry of the panther and the howl of the wolf, now
far in the distance, now close at hand.</p>

<p>But brave by nature and strong in faith, Kenneth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
committed himself to the care of Him who neither
slumbers nor sleeps, and there in the wilderness rested
as securely in the shadow of His wing, as though in the
midst of civilization and compassed by walls and bulwarks.</p>

<p>But in regard to the success or failure of the object
of his journey he was not equally calm and trustful.
How is it that our faith is apt to be so weak in respect
to our Father's loving control of those things which affect
our happiness in this life, even when we trust to Him
unhesitatingly the far greater interests of eternity? Ah
how slow we are to believe that word, "We know that
all things work together for good to them that love God."</p>

<p>Such was Kenneth's experience at this time, earnestly
striving, yet with but partial success, to throw off the
burden of care and anxiety that oppressed him, now
urging his steed forward with almost feverish haste,
himself half panting with eagerness and excitement, and
anon bringing it to a walk, while with head drooping and
heavy sighs bursting from his bosom he seemed half
inclined to turn and retrace his steps.</p>

<p>This hesitation, this shirking from the result of his
quest, grew upon him as he advanced; but at length,
"What weakness is this?" he cried aloud. "God helping
me, I will throw it off and meet this crisis with Christian
courage. Should the very worst come, it cannot
peril that which I have committed to His hand. Blessed
be His holy name for that gracious word, 'I give unto
them eternal life: and they shall never perish, neither
shall any pluck them out of my hand.'"</p>

<p>With the last words his voice rang out triumphantly
on the silent air. Romeo pricked up his ears at the
sound and quickened his pace to a rapid canter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
"Right, my brave fellow!" said his master, patting
his neck; "on now with spirit, we are not far from the end
of this long jaunt."</p>

<p>They were crossing a prairie, a sea of waving grass
bespangled with flowers of many and gorgeous hues,
beyond which lay a thick wood.</p>

<p>It was afternoon of the third day and the sun near its
setting, as they plunged into the wood. Here the light
had already grown dim, and soon darkness compelled a
halt.</p>

<p>Kenneth dismounted, secured his horse in the usual
way, gathered dry branches and leaves, and with the
aid of flint and steel had presently a bright fire blazing.</p>

<p>A couple of birds which he had shot during the day,
hung at his saddle bow. These he quickly stripped of
their feathers and prepared for cooking, which he managed
by suspending them before the fire, each on the end
of a pointed stick whose other end was thrust well into
the ground.</p>

<p>A bit of corn-bread from his saddle-bags, and water
from a running stream near by, filled up the complement
of viands that formed his simple repast.</p>

<p>He had but just begun it when a slight sound like the
crackling of a dry twig, near at hand, made him look
up.</p>

<p>The flickering firelight showed him a tall dark form
creeping stealthily toward him, another and much smaller
one close at its heels.</p>

<p>He instinctively put out his hand for his gun, lying by
his side, then drew it back as he perceived that the
approaching strangers were a woman and child. The
former was wrapped in an Indian blanket, and carried a
papoose on her back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
"Me friend," she said in broken English. "Me hungry;
papoose hungry," pointing to the little one trotting
at her side.</p>

<p>"Sit down and I will feed you," Kenneth answered,
making room for her near the fire.</p>

<p>She seated herself upon the roots of a tree, the child
crouching at her feet, laid the babe, which was sleeping
soundly, across her lap, and taking the food he offered
shared it with the other child.</p>

<p>Something in her look and manner half startled
Kenneth. He hastily threw a pine knot upon the fire.
It burst into a bright blaze, throwing a strong light
upon the face and figure of the stranger, and Kenneth's
heart throbbed as he looked keenly at her, at first beating
high with hope, then almost it stood still in disappointment
and despair.</p>

<p>"She is too young," he sighed to himself; then
speaking aloud, "You are a white woman," he said.</p>

<p>"Squaw," she answered, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"You have grown up among the Indians and perhaps
forgotten your own parents," he remarked, gazing
earnestly upon her, "but your blood is white; you have
not an Indian feature; your eyes are blue, your hair is
red and curly."</p>

<p>She evidently but half comprehended what he was
saying, gave him no answer save an enquiring bewildered
look.</p>

<p>He called to his aid the slight knowledge he had gained
of the Indian tongue, and at length succeeded in making
himself understood.</p>

<p>At first she utterly denied that she belonged to the
white race, repeating her assertion that she was a squaw,
but finally admitted that he was right, acknowledging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
that she had a faint recollection of being carried away by
the Indians in her very early childhood.</p>

<p>He asked if she would not like to go back; at which
she answered very emphatically that she would not, she
was the squaw of a young Indian brave, and the mother
of these his children; loved husband and children dearly,
and would on no account leave them.</p>

<p>She had strayed from her camp that day and lost
her way in the woods, but would find it again and go
back to the Indian village, distant not more than two or
three miles, when the moon was up.</p>

<p>He ceased his persuasions, but regarded her with interest,
thinking how sad it was that the child of civilized,
perhaps Christian, parents should have become so entirely
savage.</p>

<p>He asked if she knew of any other white woman among
the Indians.</p>

<p>She did not.</p>

<p>He talked to her of God and of Christ, telling the
sweet story of the cross, but was doubtful how much of
it she was able to grasp.</p>

<p>She listened with a half interested, half puzzled air, a
gleam of intelligence occasionally lighting up her somewhat
stolid face.</p>

<p>But the silvery rays of the moon came stealing through
the branches overhead, and, rousing the older child, who
had fallen asleep on the ground at her feet, the woman
arose, shouldered her still slumbering babe, and wrapping
her blanket about her, gave Kenneth a farewell nod, and
with the little one trotting at her heels as before, quickly
disappeared amid the deep shadows of the wood.</p>

<p>The object of Kenneth's journey had been accomplished;
the tiny flame of hope enkindled by the information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
gleaned from the hunter had gone out in darkness,
and naught remained for him but to take up again his
burden of secret grief and care, and go on with life's
duties with what courage and patience he might.</p>

<p>Weary with the day's travel, he yet made no movement
toward preparation for sleep. Long hours he sat over
his fire in an attitude of deep despondency, hands clasped
about his knees, head bowed upon his breast; then kneeling
upon the ground he poured out his soul in prayer.</p>

<p>"Lord, the cross is very heavy, the cup very bitter,
yet how light and sweet compared with what thou didst
bear and drink for me! Forgive, oh, forgive the sin of
thy servant! Who am I that I dare complain or murmur?
Lord, hear the cry of thy servant! strengthen him
that he rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him;
though it be till his feet stand upon the other shore."</p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_vii" id="chapter_vii">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>There was as yet no post-office in Chillicothe, and no
regular mail. One came occasionally, brought by a man
on horseback, and its arrival was always an event fraught
with deep interest to most of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>This occurred during Kenneth's absence, for the first
time in many weeks. There was a letter for him from
Glen Forest, of which Dale took possession, paying the
postage.</p>

<p>"When will your master be home?" he asked of Zeb,
who was lounging before the office door.</p>

<p>"Dunno, sah; he didn't say, sah."</p>

<p>"Where did he go?"</p>

<p>"Dunno, sah; said he gwine on a hunt; wouldn't be
home for two or three days."</p>

<p>"Two or three days! and he's been gone nearly a
week," exclaimed Dale, stepping into his office. "Nearly
a week," he went on thinking aloud, as he seated himself
at his desk and laid the letter on it. "I wonder if we
shouldn't turn out in a body and hunt for him; he may
have met with an accident or&mdash;the treacherous savage!"</p>

<p>He frowned anxiously at the letter for a moment, then
with sudden recollection turned from it to busy himself
with his own correspondence. Several letters had come
for him, and they must be read, digested, and answered.
They absorbed his attention for some hours, then came
the call to supper, and still Dr. Clendenin was missing.</p>

<p>Dale was growing very uneasy; Kenneth had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
as a brother to him. "I must do something," he said
to himself on his return to his office, taking up the letter
again and gazing earnestly at it. "What can have
become of him? Where can he have gone? If he isn't
here within an hour, I shall go and consult the major.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he went on musingly, still gazing at the missive
in his hand, "wouldn't he put spurs to his horse, if he
knew this was here waiting for him, that is, if he's alive
and free? How eager he always is for these letters, yet
never opens one before anybody, never alludes to their
contents.</p>

<p>"And they always seem to increase that mysterious
trouble that he keeps so carefully to himself, and tries so
hard to throw off, even when he and I are quite alone
together."</p>

<p>But at that instant there was a sound of horse's hoofs
in the street without, then a glad exclamation from Zeb,
"Ki, massa doctah! thought the Injuns got you dis time,
suah!" and, throwing down the letter, Dale rushed to
the door to greet his friend.</p>

<p>Kenneth was in the act of dismounting, saying in a
kindly tone to Zeb, as he gave him the reins, "No;
here I am quite safe. Has there been any letter or message
for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there was a mail to-day," Dale said, stepping
forward and grasping his friend's hand with affectionate
warmth. "A letter for you. Come in, I have it here.
But," with a look of surprise and concern at the haggard
face and drooping figure, "you are ill, my dear fellow!"</p>

<p>"Not at all, only somewhat weary and worn," Kenneth
answered, with a faint smile that had neither mirth
nor gladness in it. "But the letter, Godfrey! Is it
from&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
"Glen Forest? Yes; the superscription, I noticed, is
in the usual hand, post-mark the same as on the others.
Here it is. Take this chair, and while you read I'll run
over and tell Tiffin to see that they get a hot supper
ready for you."</p>

<p>Putting the missive into Kenneth's eager, almost
trembling, hand, he hurried away before the latter could
utter a word of thanks.</p>

<p>For weeks Kenneth had been hungering for this letter,
yet now that he held it in his hand he seemed to
have need to gather up courage for its perusal. For a
moment he sat with closed eyes, lips moving, though no
sound came from them; then he broke the seal and
read; at first eagerly, hastily, with bated breath, then,
turning back to the beginning, with more care and
deliberation, dwelling upon each sentence, while the
shadow deepened on his brow, and again and again his
broad breast heaved with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>At length, at the sound of approaching footsteps, he
rose and retreated to his own office, at the same time
refolding the letter and putting it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Dale had delayed purposely on his errand, stopping
to chat now with one, now with another, in the tavern,
then in the street.</p>

<p>At his own door he was met by Major Lamar with the
question, "Any news of the doctor yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's just back; looking quite worn out, too."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm sorry to hear that. I can see him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; walk right in. I left him&mdash;why, no, he
isn't here! Sit down, major, and I'll hunt him up."</p>

<p>But here let us go back and tell of some occurrences of
the previous day in the major's family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Early in the afternoon Tig was standing with elbows
on the fence and chin in hands, lazily watching the sports
of the children as they vied with each other in the agility
with which they could leap over stumps and logs, when
Silvy's voice came sharply to his ears, "Tiglath Pileser,
you lazy niggah, what you doin' dar? Didn't I tole you
to clean de knives? Now Miss Nell is ready for to go
ridin' and you just go right 'long and fotch de hosses
roun' soon's eber you kin git dem saddled."</p>

<p>"Am I to go 'long, mother?" queried Tig, turning
with alacrity to obey; for the horses were the pride of
his heart, a ride with Miss Nell his greatest delight, especially
when he was her sole companion and protector;
and to-day he thought he should be, as he knew of no
other escort.</p>

<p>His mother's reply confirmed his hopes. "Course you
is; you always gets dat honor when dar ain't no gentleman
'bout."</p>

<p>Tig made haste to the stable, saddled and bridled
Fairy and a pony belonging to the major with unaccustomed
speed, and led them round to the front door,
where Miss Nell was waiting in riding hat and habit.</p>

<p>"You were very quick this time, Tig," she said with
an approving smile.</p>

<p>"Ki! Miss Nell," he answered, grinning from ear to
ear, "no wondah; I'se in a big hurry, les' some dem
gentlemen mout be comin' 'long 'fo' we gets off."</p>

<p>"What gentlemen, Tig?" she asked, laughing, as she
stepped upon the horse-block and sprang lightly into the
saddle.</p>

<p>"Oh, de doctah, or Mistah Dale, or some dem other
gentlemen. 'Tain't often dis chile gets a chance to take
care ob you, Miss Nell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
"Do you think you can take care of her, Tig?" asked
Mrs. Lamar, coming to the door with a basket in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Guess I kin, mistis, I ain't 'fraid no Injuns, nor
b'ars, nor painters!" cried the boy, straightening himself
with an air of injured dignity.</p>

<p>"Don't boast, Tig, till your courage has been put to
the test," answered his mistress. "Here, take this
basket and see if you can get it full of ripe mulberries
for tea. Nell, I really don't feel quite sure that I ought
to let you go without a better protector."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Clare! I've done it before," returned
the young girl, her color rising. "And the responsibility
is not yours, I'm old enough to decide such matters
for myself." And with that she touched Fairy lightly
with the whip and cantered off, Tig following close in
her rear. It was a lovely summer afternoon, the heat of
the sun tempered by a cool, refreshing breeze. Fairy
had scarcely been out of the stable for a day or two and
was full of spirit, and Nell reveled in the delight of
dashing away at almost headlong speed through the forest
and over the prairies.</p>

<p>So enjoyable did she find the swift movement, with the
sense of wild freedom it gave her, the beauty of the landscape,
the sweet scent of the woods and wild flowers,
that she went much farther than she had at first intended,
or, indeed, was aware of.</p>

<p>Then coming back she stopped with Tig under a
cluster of mulberry trees on the edge of a prairie, to fill
the basket with fruit.</p>

<p>Not caring to stain her pretty fingers, she left the boy
to fulfil the task alone, while she wandered to and fro,
gathering flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
The sun was getting low as they remounted.</p>

<p>"We must hurry, Tig," Nell said, glancing uneasily
toward the west. "I did not think we had been here so
long."</p>

<p>They sped across the prairie and entered the wood
that lay between it and the town. Here it was already
dusk, and Nell urged Fairy on, her heart beating fast,
while she glanced hither and thither, seeming to see an
Indian, a bear, wolf, or panther behind every tree.</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught sight of a pair of fiery eyes glaring
upon her from an overhanging branch, and the next
instant, with a low, fierce growl, something leaped upon
the back of her horse, a huge paw was laid on her
shoulder, a hot breath fanned her cheek, while a wild
shriek from Tig rang in her ears, and Fairy reared and
snorted with fear.</p>

<p>Oh, the mortal terror that seized upon Nell, almost
freezing the blood in her veins! Closing her eyes she
leant forward and threw her arms about the neck of her
pony, clinging to it in frantic terror for what seemed an
age of suffering, but was in reality scarcely a moment.</p>

<p>A bullet, sped by an unerring hand, struck the panther
in the eye, and it fell to the ground dead.</p>

<p>A horseman, hurrying from the direction of the town,
put spurs to his steed at sound of the report of the gun,
and almost before its echoes had died away, Nell was in
her brother's arms.</p>

<p>He soothed and caressed her, she lying on his breast,
sobbing and speechless with fright.</p>

<p>"Ugh! big fellow!" grunted a voice near at hand,
and Nell, looking up, saw a tall Indian standing over the
prostrate wild cat, the outline of whose form could be
dimly discovered in the fading light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
"Wawillaway," said the major, holding out his hand
to the chief, "you have saved my sister's life, and I can
never fully return the obligation! Come with us to
Chillicothe. My house shall be your home whenever
you choose to make it so."</p>

<p>Wawillaway grasped the offered hand in one of his
own, while with the other he held the bridle of Fairy,
who was shying at the dead panther, and trembling and
snorting with fear.</p>

<p>"Indian good gun," he said. "Indian go to white
man's wigwam. Come, white squaw very much 'fraid."</p>

<p>"Yes, Nell, we had better go; for it grows darker
every moment. Can you sit your horse now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, "I must. But oh, Percy, keep
close to me!"</p>

<p>"As close as I can. I will lead your horse," he
answered, as he placed her in the saddle. "But where is
Tig? I thought he was with you."</p>

<p>Tig had fled in overpowering terror, at the instant of
the discharge of Wawillaway's gun, and on reaching
home they found him there, telling an incoherent story of
attacking Indians and wild cats, that filled the household
with alarm.</p>

<p>Great was their relief at the sight of the major and his
sister, though Nell was in a state of nervous prostration
and excitement that made it necessary to put her at once
to bed and watch by her during the night.</p>

<p>The next day she was but little better, and on her account
her brother had been anxiously looking for Dr.
Clendenin's return, and had now come in search of
him.</p>

<p>Kenneth was not long in making his appearance. His
manner was calm and quiet as usual, and shaking hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
with the major, who expressed hearty satisfaction at seeing
him again, he asked if the family were all well.</p>

<p>"All but Nell," was the reply, "and I don't know
that there's much amiss with her. But I should like you
to see her. She had a terrible fright yesterday, and
doesn't seem to get over it."</p>

<p>Kenneth's look was anxious and inquiring.</p>

<p>"I supposed you had heard&mdash;" the major began, but
Dale interrupted, "No, no, he hasn't had time to hear
anything yet, or even to eat; and here comes Zeb with
his supper. I told him to bring it over to your office,
doctor."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Kenneth, "but it can wait. I will
go with you at once, major."</p>

<p>But the major would not hear of it.</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," he insisted. "Besides you ought
to hear the story of her fright before seeing her, and may
as well do so while breaking your fast."</p>

<p>Kenneth yielded, for he had not tasted food since
early morning, and felt in sore need of it.</p>

<p>"What can we do for her?" asked the major in conclusion.</p>

<p>"Divert her mind from the subject as much as possible,"
returned the doctor. "Dosing is not what she
needs."</p>

<p>"My opinion exactly," responded the major, "but I
must crave your assistance in applying your prescription."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear sir, I will do my best."</p>

<p>It was a fair summer evening, the sun just touching
the treetops, as Kenneth left his office in company with
the major.</p>

<p>People were gathered about the doors of their dwellings
or places of business, the day's work done for most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of the men, though the busy housewives still plied the
needle, sewing or knitting; thus exemplifying the truth
of the old adage, "Man's work is from sun to sun, but a
woman's work is never done."</p>

<p>Children played hide and seek among the trees, their
glad voices ringing out upon the quiet air in merry
shouts and silvery laughter; but many of them, on
catching sight of Kenneth, left their sport to run and
take him by the hand, welcoming him with eager delight,
and asking him where he had been so long.</p>

<p>Older people, too, crowded about him with a like greeting
and the same question.</p>

<p>He parried it as best he might, not feeling disposed to
be communicative on the subject, returned the handshakings
and kindly greetings, and asked after the health
of each family represented.</p>

<p>"You have won all hearts here, Dr. Clendenin," the
major remarked, when at length they had parted with
the last of the friendly interrogators and were drawing
near his own door.</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe it is so!" Kenneth answered, with a glad
lighting up of his grave, almost sad face, "and I sometimes
wonder how it has come about."</p>

<p>"Love begets love, and so it is with disinterested kindness
also," the major answered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamar, coming to meet them, caught the last
words. "Quite true," she assented, holding out a hand
to Kenneth, "and I know of no one else in whose case
we see such an exemplification of that fact as in Dr. Clendenin's.
Doctor, running away so suddenly and mysteriously,
you left many an anxious heart behind you."</p>

<p>She gave him a look of keen curiosity as she spoke.
But he would not take the hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
"My friends are very kind and I would not willingly
cause them a moment's uneasiness," was all he said. It
was gently spoken, but tone and manner did not invite
a further display of inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>Nell, seated in the doorway in a listless attitude, rose
suddenly on perceiving her brother's approach and who
was with him, and, overcome by an unaccountable fit of
shyness, hastily retreated into the house, her heart beating
fast, the hot blood dyeing her cheek.</p>

<p>Then, much vexed with herself, she turned at the sound
of Kenneth's voice saying "Good evening," and gave
him her hand with a murmured "How do you do,
doctor?"</p>

<p>He made her sit down, and drew up a chair for himself
close to her side.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of me because I come in my professional
capacity," he said in a playful tone, again taking
her hand and laying a finger on her pulse.</p>

<p>"You needn't," she said with a little pout, and seeming
half inclined to jerk the hand away. "I'm not sick. I
wonder what nonsense Percy's been telling you."</p>

<p>They were alone; the major and his wife had wandered
on up the street; the children were sporting outside with
their mates.</p>

<p>"None at all," he answered with his grave smile, "only
that your nerves have had a shock from which they do
not find it easy to recover."</p>

<p>"I'm not sick, and I won't be called nervous! I just
wish people would let me alone!" she cried angrily,
bursting into tears in spite of herself. "Oh dear! oh
dear!" she sobbed, "I don't know what has come over
me! I never was so ill-tempered or so babyish before!"</p>

<p>"Don't be vexed with me for saying it is because you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
are not well," he answered soothingly. "Let the tears
have their way and they will relieve you greatly."</p>

<p>She cried quite heartily for a moment, then wiping
away her tears, said with half averted face, and in a tone
of suppressed horror, shuddering as she spoke, "Oh, I
cannot forget it!&mdash;those fiery eyes gleaming out at me
in the darkness, the heavy paw on my shoulder, the hot
breath on my cheek! I seem to see and feel them all the
time, sleeping or waking. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Try to forget it," he said gently; "turn your thoughts
as much as possible to other things, and the effect of your
fright will gradually wear away."</p>

<p>"I cannot forget it," she answered sadly. "I shall
always be afraid to go into the woods now, and my walks
and rides were the greatest pleasures I had."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," he said, "the wild animals will soon be
driven from our immediate neighborhood; and in the
meantime you must go well protected. My dear Miss
Nell," he added in lower, sweeter tones, "you know
there is One whose protecting care is over us at all times
and in all places. Try to trust in Him with a simple,
childlike confidence; such faith will do more to give you
calmness and peace than anything else can."</p>

<p>A moment's pause; then turning the conversation
upon other themes, he exerted himself for her entertainment
till the major and his wife came in, when he shortly
took his leave; for there were other patients requiring
his attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_viii" id="chapter_viii">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>"How did you find Miss Lamar, doctor? Anything
much the matter?" asked Dale, sauntering into his
friend's office that evening, shortly after the return of the
latter from his round of visits among his patients.</p>

<p>Kenneth sat at his table, spatula in hand, making pills,
a slight cloud of care on his brow.</p>

<p>His reply was not a direct answer to the question.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Godfrey," he said. "I've been thinking
of calling in your aid in the management of this case."</p>

<p>"Mine?" laughed Dale.</p>

<p>"Yes, as consulting physician."</p>

<p>"You are certainly jesting, yet you look as grave as a
judge on the bench."</p>

<p>"I wish," Kenneth said, pausing for an instant in his
work and looking earnestly at Dale, "that there was
more young society here, more to amuse and interest a
young girl like Miss Lamar. Can't you help me to think
of something new?"</p>

<p>"Boating parties," suggested Dale.</p>

<p>"That will do for one thing. Now what else?"</p>

<p>"Get up a class in botany. I'll join it. You are quite
an enthusiast in that line and know a great deal more on
the subject than any one else about here."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I should enjoy it if others would. Anything
more?"</p>

<p>"No, I should say I'd done my share of thinking, and
you must finish up the job yourself, you who are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
pocket the fee," returned Dale laughing. "Now I'm off,
prescribing a night's rest for you, to be taken at once;
for you are looking wretchedly worn out."</p>

<p>Very weary Kenneth certainly was, yet the friendly
counsel was not taken. His work finished, he pushed
his implements aside, and sat long with his folded arms
upon the table, his head resting on them; not sleeping,
for now and again a heavy sigh, or a few low breathed
words of prayer came from his lips.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, for them, for them, I beseech thee, in the
midst of wrath remember mercy! Let them rest under
the shadow of thy wing, till these calamities be overpast."</p>

<p>Both Dale's suggestions in the line of amusements were
promptly carried out, and with excellent effect upon the
patient. She was fond of plants and flowers, and Kenneth
proved a capital teacher. Mrs. Lamar and several
others, both married and single, joined the class and they
had many a pleasant ramble over hill and valley in
search of specimens.</p>

<p>The major provided a boat for the rowing parties and
frequently made one of them himself, taking special care
of his young sister.</p>

<p>When he was not present Kenneth took his place in
this particular, but not at all in a lover-like way; his
manner was fraternal, "sometimes almost paternal,"
Nell thought, with an emotion of anger and pique at
"being treated so like a child."</p>

<p>"It is because I was so silly as to cry before him! He
thinks me a mere baby," she said to herself now and
again, in extreme vexation.</p>

<p>She was apt to be frank in the expression, or rather
exhibition of her feelings, and Kenneth was at times not
a little puzzled to understand in what he had offended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
He never blamed her, however, but, attributing her displeasure
to some fault or awkwardness in himself,
redoubled his kindly attention, and his efforts to give
pleasant and healthful occupation to her thoughts.</p>

<p>With this in view he would often take a book from his
pocket, when he found himself alone with her, read aloud
some passage that he particularly admired, and draw her
into conversation about it.</p>

<p>Also he tried to interest her in his patients, occasionally
taking her with him where he knew her visits would
be welcome, and engaging her to prepare dainties to
tempt the sickly appetites, and clothing for such as
were poor enough to need assistance of that kind.</p>

<p>His only thought, so far as she was concerned, was to
comfort and relieve, and it did not occur to him that
there might be danger in the cure, for her as for himself.</p>

<p>Yet there was; for how could the girl gain such an
insight into the noble generosity and unselfishness of his
character, without learning to love him? It was not only
his unvarying kindness towards herself, his patient forbearance
even in her most petulant and unreasonable
moods, but also his sympathy for, and gentleness toward,
even the very poorest and most uninteresting and ungrateful
of those who invoked his aid as a physician, his
anxiety and untiring efforts to relieve suffering, and his
unselfish joy when those efforts were successful.</p>

<p>Also his deep, humble, unassuming piety, and earnest
desire to lead to the Great Physician, that there might be
healing of soul as well as body.</p>

<p>Her admiration and respect grew day by day, until he
seemed to her an example of all that was good and great
and lovable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Dale, too, unwittingly helped on the mischief. He had
some notion of courting pretty Nell himself, so did not
care to interest her too much in Kenneth; but his thoughts
were often full of the latter, the strange secret that
seemed to darken his life; and remembering Kenneth's
expressed desire to engage Nell's thoughts upon matters
that would take them from herself and the unfortunate
occurrence that had shaken her nerves, and calling to
mind also that she had come from the same neighborhood
with Kenneth and would be likely to know the family
history of the Clendenins, he deemed it no harm to
broach the subject one day when alone with her, and ask
if she could guess what their friend's sorrow was.</p>

<p>"No," she said in surprise. "I never heard of anything
that could cause him such grief. They are well-to-do
people, living on a lovely place of their own; they
are most highly respected too. I frequently heard
them spoken of, always in the highest terms, and never
heard of any trouble, except that Kenneth's twin brother
was drowned ten or twelve years ago. But surely he
could not be grieving so over that now!"</p>

<p>"No, it can't be that." Dale said musingly, "it is evidently
a deeper sorrow than any such bereavement could
bring, or at least a grief and burden of a different
sort."</p>

<p>"Are you not mistaken? May it not be a mere fancy
on your part?" queried Nell. "Dr. Clendenin has always
struck me as a very cheerful person."</p>

<p>"He is not one to obtrude his griefs upon others,"
observed Dale in reply. "He forces himself to be cheerful
when in general society, and seldom allows even me,
his intimate friend, to perceive that he has a burden to
bear; but I have reason to believe that he sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
passes half the night pacing his office instead of taking
the rest he needs after his day's toil."</p>

<p>From that, he went on to speak of Kenneth's late mysterious,
lonely journey, and to describe the state in which
he had returned.</p>

<p>Nell's heart was deeply touched. "How noble he
is!" was her mental exclamation. "But Mr. Dale
should not have told me, it seems almost like betraying
his friend's confidence. I suppose he does not look upon
it in that light, but I am quite sure Dr. Clendenin would
never have done so by him."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Dale, breaking the momentary
silence, "this is between ourselves. I have never mentioned
these things to any one else, and never shall."</p>

<p>"Nor shall I, Mr. Dale," she answered.</p>

<p>She did not, but from that time she watched Kenneth
more closely than ever before, and that with the growing
conviction that Dale was right.</p>

<p>It became with her an absorbingly interesting subject
of thought; her heart was more and more filled with pity
for Kenneth's silent suffering, and pity is akin to love.</p>

<p>But what could be the cause of this strange, silent
anguish? Was it unrequited love? She spurned the
thought. What! he of all men to sue in vain? It could
not be! What woman's heart could withstand such a
siege?</p>

<p>She did not care for him in that way&mdash;oh no, not she;
but that was quite another thing, he had not sought her,
and she was not one to give her heart unasked.</p>

<p>The town was growing, the country rapidly filling up
with settlers, mostly of the better class, refined, intelligent,
educated and pious people.</p>

<p>Also many gentlemen from the older states, principally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Virginia and Kentucky, came to look at land with
a view to purchasing, and these always sought out Major
Lamar and were hospitably entertained by him.</p>

<p>Thus Nell saw a great deal of society. She
enjoyed it too, was a general favorite, and formed
some pleasant friendships with these guests of the family;
but half unconsciously she made Dr. Clendenin her
standard of manly perfection, and found all others short
of it.</p>

<p>While, however, in some of these visitors possible
lovers might have been found, many were men in middle
life, old companions in arms of the major. And these
were not the least welcome to Nell, for she loved to sit
and listen to them and her brother as they fought their
battles over again around the fire in the cool spring or
autumn evenings; or on the green sward before the
door in the warm summer nights.</p>

<p>Few of them came in winter, and at that season boating,
botanizing and long rambles into the country had of
course to be given up, yet that less favored time was
not without its quiet pleasures.</p>

<p>There was much spinning, weaving, sewing and
knitting going on, the ladies often carried their work
to a neighbor's house and spent a sociable afternoon
together, winding up with an early tea. There
were also social gatherings about the fire in the
evenings, enlivened by cheerful chat, the cracking of
nuts, several varieties of which were found in great
abundance in the woods around the village, and scraping
turnip, these last being used as a substitute for apples,
until time had been given for their cultivation.</p>

<p>Thus had the summer passed, the autumn too, and
midwinter had come, finding Nell fully recovered from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the effects of her fright, her fears dispelled, her nerves as
steady as ever they had been.</p>

<p>It was the second winter since her arrival in Chillicothe,
and she had become really attached to the place and its
cheerful social life, so free from formality and restraint.</p>

<p>Calling at the major's one evening, Kenneth found her
alone in the sitting-room, quietly knitting and thinking
beside the fire.</p>

<p>The wide chimney was heaped high with hickory logs,
and the dancing, flickering flames filled the whole room
with a cheerful, ruddy light.</p>

<p>Nell's back was toward the door and she did not perceive
his entrance, till he spoke close at her side, his
pleasant "Good evening, I hope I do not intrude?"
rousing her from her reverie.</p>

<p>"Oh no, doctor, you are always welcome in this house,"
she said, rising to give him her hand, and inviting him to
be seated.</p>

<p>"I knocked," he said apologetically, "but no one
seemed to hear, so I ventured to admit myself."</p>

<p>"Quite right," she answered, "though I do not understand
how I happened to miss hearing your rap."</p>

<p>"Preoccupation," he remarked with a half absent
smile, gazing thoughtfully into the fire as he spoke.
"You are all quite well?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you. My brother and sister are out
spending the evening; and the children are in bed."</p>

<p>He did not speak again for several minutes, but sat
watching the flames as they leaped hither and thither,
but evidently with thoughts far away; and Nell, furtively
studying his countenance, read there the silent suffering
Dale had spoken of.</p>

<p>Her woman's heart longed to speak a word of sympathy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and comfort; but how should she when she knew
not what his sorrow was?</p>

<p>"I am glad," he said at length, "to hear that you are
all well. I am going away, and could not feel satisfied
to do so without learning that my services were not
needed here."</p>

<p>"Going away?" she echoed. "We had not heard of
it."</p>

<p>"No; it is scarcely an hour since I knew it myself."</p>

<p>"Where? how long?" she asked impetuously, with
changed countenance; then blushing to think she had
betrayed so much curiosity and interest&mdash;"Excuse me,
but Percy and Clare will be anxious to know; some of
us may be taken sick."</p>

<p>"Yes; but we will hope not," he said, in the same
calm, even tone he had used all along, his gaze still fixed
upon the fire. "I go out into the wilderness, Miss Nell,
and the time of my return is uncertain."</p>

<p>"Now! in this most inclement season of the year?"
she exclaimed. "Isn't it running a great risk? would it
not be wiser to put off your journey till spring opens?"</p>

<p>"I think not," he answered slowly; "life is uncertain,
and what my hand finds to do must be done with my
might."</p>

<p>"But if you lose your life?"</p>

<p>"It will be in the path of duty; and there are some
things worth even that risk, Miss Nell."</p>

<p>He turned his head, and his eyes looked full into hers.</p>

<p>"They must be of very great importance," she
answered, returning his look with one as calm and quiet as
his own, though her pulses quickened at the thought
that he was perhaps about to appeal to her for sympathy
in his mysterious sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
But he did not.</p>

<p>"Do you not agree in my opinion?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; if I had been in Percy's place when the war
broke out, I would have done just as he did&mdash;periled
my life and all I had for my country," she said with kindling
eyes.</p>

<p>He smiled approval, then rising, "Good-by, Miss
Nell," he said, taking her hand in his, "I must away."</p>

<p>"What! to-night? and do you go alone?"</p>

<p>"I start to-night, Wawillaway is to be my guide a part
of the way," he said; "after that my horse and gun will
be my sole companions."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't you get Wawillaway to go with you all the
way? I should feel&mdash;so much more hopeful for your safe
return!" she exclaimed; then blushing deeply, as she
saw his face light up with pleasure while he asked,</p>

<p>"Do you really care for that?" she hastily withdrew
her hand, saying almost pettishly:</p>

<p>"Of course I care to have you here in case any of the
family should be taken sick. You understand our constitution,
and are the only doctor in the town that we
have the least confidence in."</p>

<p>His countenance fell, and she thought she heard a
faint sigh as he turned sadly away, and with a silent bow
left the house.</p>

<p>She dropped into a chair, hid her face in her hands,
and burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could I! how could I! when he has been so
good and kind to me!" she sobbed. "It's just as if I
had struck him a cruel blow, and oh! I could beat myself
for it!"</p>

<p>Her words, and yet more her tone and manner in
speaking them, had indeed wounded Kenneth. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
brought a care-burdened and sorrowful heart into her
presence, and he carried it away with an added pang.</p>

<p>He was himself surprised to find that she had power
to wound him so deeply. He had not known before
how dear the wilful little maiden had become to him;
but this pain opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, what have I been doing?" he cried, half aloud,
as he strode onward toward his office, "and why am I
regretting that for which I should be unutterably thankful&mdash;that
I alone suffer, because of my imprudence? I must,
I will be grateful that she has not given her young heart
to such a one as I. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;but ah me, this
is hoping even against hope! Yet will I not utterly
despair, for with God all things are possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_ix" id="chapter_ix">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Nell cried till she brought on a slight headache, then
made that an excuse for going to bed before the return
of her brother and his wife. She did not want to face
the keen scrutiny of Clare, who would be sure to detect
the traces of tears and to make a shrewd guess at their
cause.</p>

<p>The girl had ample space for repentance, overpowering
anxiety and dread in the next two or three weeks;
and though she continued to hide her feelings from those
about her, seeming quite as light hearted and gay as was
her wont, the darkness of night was witness to many
sighs and tears.</p>

<p>Dale came in on the evening after her late interview
with Kenneth, and seizing an opportunity for a few
words in private, asked her what she thought of Dr.
Clendenin's starting off upon such a journey at that
inclement season of the year.</p>

<p>"Why should I trouble myself about it?" Nell asked,
with a slight toss of her pretty head. "I presume the
doctor knows his own business."</p>

<p>"Possibly," returned Dale, with gravity, "but can you
conjecture what that business is?"</p>

<p>"Can you?" she asked. "Perhaps some Indian chief
is ill, or has a sick wife or child, and wishes to test
the skill of the medicine man of the whites."</p>

<p>"Your ingenuity does you credit, Miss Lamar,"
remarked Dale, poking the fire, "but I am satisfied that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Clendenin has gone on the same errand that took him
before; and that is a chase after a white woman living
among the Indians."</p>

<p>"A relative?" queried Nell, with interest.</p>

<p>"No; he told me he had never had relative or friend
taken by them; and that is what makes his evident
anxiety to find her so puzzling, so utterly inexplicable to
me."</p>

<p>"Neither relative nor friend," pondered Nell, as she
lay awake that night, listening to the sough of the wind
around the house, the creaking of the trees in its fierce
blast, the rattle of sleet against the outer wall, and the
distant howl of the prairie wolf, and thinking of Kenneth
without shelter from storm or wild beast, "if it were his
lady love he would never say that."</p>

<p>This was not a heavy or lasting storm, the morning
sun rose in a clear sky, and several days of mild bright
weather followed.</p>

<p>After that it grew bitterly cold, and for many hours a
fierce tempest raged, and the snow fell fast, the wind
whirling it furiously about till all the roads and paths
were blocked up with it, and in places the drifts were
many feet deep.</p>

<p>Kenneth was on his homeward way when this storm
began, with, as he had said, no companion save his horse
and his gun.</p>

<p>On the latter was his principal reliance for a supply of
food, though he had in his saddle-bags sufficient coarse
corn-bread to keep him from actual starvation.</p>

<p>And well was it for him that he had come so provided,
as the whirling, blinding snow rendered the pursuit of
game impossible for the time being.</p>

<p>Indeed he soon found it impossible to continue his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
journey, and coming upon a comparatively sheltered
spot, at the foot of a rock, he dismounted, secured his
horse, and with some difficulty collecting a supply of dry
branches, twigs, bark and leaves, finally succeeded in
kindling a fire with his flint and steel and a bit of burnt
rag which he carried for the purpose in his tinder box.</p>

<p>His mission had not been successful and his heart was
heavy with disappointment, care and grief, as he sat
there over his fire listening to the howling of the storm
as the wind swept through the forest, the giant trees
bending and creaking in the blast, groaning, breaking,
falling before it and beneath the weight of snow and
sleet.</p>

<p>At length there was a slight lull in the tempest, and
Kenneth crept out from his hiding place and wandered
hither and thither in search of fuel with which to replenish
his fire.</p>

<p>Plunging into a snowdrift his foot caught in something
and he had nearly fallen over&mdash;what? was it a
log? Surely not! His heart gave a wild throb, he
stooped, and hastily brushing away the snow found an
Indian lad sleeping that fatal sleep, that, undisturbed,
ends in death.</p>

<p>Exerting all his strength, Kenneth took the boy in his
arms, shook him roughly, shouted in his ears, and catching
up a handful of snow, rubbed it briskly over the
half frozen face.</p>

<p>He dragged him to the shelter of the rock, but not
close to the fire, and continuing his efforts at length
succeeded in rousing him, and finally in restoring circulation
and warmth to his benumbed limbs.</p>

<p>Then he took him to the fire, fed him and made him
share his blanket, taking him in his arms that it might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
cover them both: and so with their feet to the fire, and
each hugged close to the other's breast, they slept
through the dark, stormy night.</p>

<p>The morning broke bright, clear and cold, icicles
depending from the trees, snow heaped high on every
side, too high to admit of moving more than a few
paces from their sheltered nook. It was as if they were
shut up in prison together.</p>

<p>The lad knew that Kenneth had saved his life and he
was very grateful. He was a Shawnee, and had been
travelling from one Indian village to another, but blinded
by the whirling sleet and snow had lost his way and at
last, overcome with fatigue, hunger and cold, had lain
down to rest and sleep.</p>

<p>He could speak but a few words of English; but
Kenneth had gained considerable knowledge of the
Shawnee tongue since making acquaintance with Wawillaway,
and was able to converse with the boy to their
mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p>They remained together for some days, keeping up
their fire and feeding on some wild turkeys Kenneth
fortunately succeeded in shooting; then parting with
kindly adieus and a hearty shake of the hand, each went
his way, Kenneth toward Chillicothe, the Indian lad in a
nearly opposite direction.</p>

<p>While yet two or three miles from the town, Kenneth
saw in the distance a white man and an Indian coming
toward him from thence.</p>

<p>They were Dale and Wawillaway, and as they drew
near the former uttered a joyous shout.</p>

<p>"Hello, doc! so here you are, safe and sound! We
feared you were buried in the snowdrifts and we'd have
to dig you out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
There was a hearty shaking of hands as they met.</p>

<p>"Did you come out in search of me?" asked Kenneth.</p>

<p>"We did," said Dale, "and are rejoiced to have
found you so easily. Your friends have been exceedingly
anxious in regard to your safety, fearing you could
hardly have weathered the heavy storm of last week.
How did you manage it?"</p>

<p>Dale and the Indian had wheeled about, and all three
were ploughing their way through the snow in the direction
of the town.</p>

<p>Kenneth answered the question as they went, with a
brief account of his sojourn at the foot of the rock in
the wilderness.</p>

<p>He said nothing of the object of his journey or
whether it had been successful; but Dale's furtive yet
searching glances read a fresh and bitter disappointment
in the weary, haggard face, and drooping figure.</p>

<p>"And my friends have been anxious for my safety, you
say?" Kenneth said inquiringly, and with a wistful look
in his large gray eyes, thinking of a fair young face
that had sometimes brightened at his coming.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dale, "it has been for the last three days
the most exciting theme of conversation with old and
young. It's a fine thing to be a doctor, if you care to
have high and low, rich and poor interested in your
safety."</p>

<p>It was the middle of the afternoon. Mrs. and Miss
Lamar plied the needle within doors while the children
were engaged in winter sports without&mdash;sledding, sliding
and snow-balling.</p>

<p>Suddenly they came tearing in, half wild with joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother and Aunt Nell, he's come! he's come!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
"Who?" and Nell's heart beat fast and loud. It had
been well nigh breaking with the thought of a manly
form lying still and cold out in the wilderness with a
snow wreath for its winding sheet, yet she had given
no sign, but seemed the gayest of the gay.</p>

<p>"Dr. Clendenin!" cried the children in chorus; "he
didn't get lost in the snow or killed by the Indians, we
just saw him ride by with Mr. Dale and Wawillaway."</p>

<p>Nell stitched away, apparently quite indifferent to the
news, but her heart sang for joy, and all the rest of the
day her ear was strained to catch the sound of his
approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>The major brought him home to tea and though Mrs.
Lamar welcomed him most cordially, and the children
hailed his coming with delight, Nell's manner was
reserved and quiet almost to coldness.</p>

<p>He took the limp, passive hand in his for an instant,
as he gave one wistful glance into the unmoved face,
then with the thought, "She does not care for me, and
it is well," yet sighing inwardly, turned away and entered
into conversation with the major and his wife.</p>

<p>"We have been very anxious about you, doctor, ever
since that fearful storm set in," Mrs. Lamar was saying.
"We feared you must perish if exposed to it. Did you
not suffer terribly?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," he answered cheerily, "I fared very well,"
and went on to tell of the sheltered rock he had found,
and that he had a fire, a good blanket and something to
eat.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it," the children begged, clustering
round him and climbing upon his knees.</p>

<p>"Were you all alone?" asked Bess; "I do think it
must be dreadful to be alone in the woods at night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
"No, I was not quite alone through it all," he said,
stroking her hair.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! you mean God was with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I had a human companion, too, an Indian
boy, who told me his name was Little Horn."</p>

<p>Nell asked no question, but she was not the least
interested of those who listened to the story of the finding
of the lad and the way in which the two passed their
time while storm-stayed together in the wood.</p>

<p>She was furtively studying Kenneth's face while he
talked, sorrowfully taking note of its worn, thin look, and
the deepening of the lines of grief and care that made it
seem older than his years warranted. Its expression at
this moment was cheerful, as were the tones of his voice,
but she had no need to be told that for him "Disappointment
still tracked the steps of hope."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_x" id="chapter_x">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Time passed on; a year, two years rolled away.
Settlers had continued to move into the town and
adjacent country, and Kenneth's practice had grown with
the growth of the population.</p>

<p>This was, perhaps, one reason why there had been a
great falling off in the frequency of his visits, other than
professional, at Major Lamar's.</p>

<p>It was, at all events, the excuse he gave, for that and
for absenting himself from nearly all the pleasure parties
and merry-makings of the young people. Genial and
pleasant in his intercourse with old and young, he yet
was no ladies' man; seldom paid attention to any of the
fair sex, except in the way of his calling; he had no time,
he said, but always found abundance of it to bestow upon
the sick and suffering. His whole heart and soul were
in his work.</p>

<p>Some silly people began to call him an old bachelor,
though he was still under thirty, and far from old looking.</p>

<p>Dale also was still single, and the two were as intimate
and warm friends as ever.</p>

<p>Godfrey was attentive to business, but, unlike Kenneth,
indulged a great fondness for ladies' society, and generally
made one in every little social gathering and pleasure
excursion, whether it were a moonlight row on river
or creek, a picnic, or expedition in search of nuts or wild
fruits, a visit to a sugar camp in the spring, or a gallop
on horseback at almost any time of year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
He was very intimate at Major Lamar's, and never
happier than when he could secure Miss Nell as his
special partner in whatever festivity was going on.</p>

<p>She liked Dale, for he was gallant, courteous, well-informed,
and a good talker of either sense or nonsense,
but she took care not to receive too much attention from
him, or to encourage hopes she never meant should be
realized.</p>

<p>She was developing into a noble, lovable woman, fair
and comely in more than ordinary degree.</p>

<p>She had a fine form, a queenly carriage, and Kenneth's
eyes often followed her with a wistful, longing look as
she passed, either riding or walking. Yet he stood
quietly aside and left it to his fellows to strive for the
prize he coveted above all other earthly good.</p>

<p>That strange, mysterious burden still rested on him,
but was borne with a brave, cheerful resignation that was
heroic.</p>

<p>There were times of deep depression, of bitter anguish
of soul, of fierce conflict with himself, when the trial
seemed more than mortal strength could bear; but these
came at rare intervals, and faith and grace ever
triumphed in the end.</p>

<p>Letters from home, where he had not visited since
emigrating to Chillicothe, and his lonely journeys into the
wilderness, of which he had made several in the interval
we have passed over, seemed alike ever to bring him
increased sadness of heart. Yet few but Dale knew this,
Kenneth's mastery over himself enabling him to put aside
his private griefs and cares when in the company of others.</p>

<p>Thus his heart was ever at leisure from itself and
ready to sympathize in the interests, the joys and sorrows
or physical sufferings of those about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
As a natural consequence, there were many who cherished
for him a very warm friendship.</p>

<p>The Nashes had removed to a farm a mile or more from
town. Mrs. Nash was still the same cheery, genial soul
she had shown herself on the journey to Ohio, and Nell
Lamar, who had ever been a favorite with the good dame,
loved to visit at the farm-house, and would sometimes
tarry there for a week or a fortnight, when conscious of
not being needed at home.</p>

<p>She and Mrs. Barbour were both there one sultry
summer day, Nell expecting to make a prolonged stay,
the other lady intending to return home in the cool of the
evening. She had now two children younger than Flora,
and had brought all three with her.</p>

<p>"It was a great deal of trouble," she complained in the
old whining, querulous tones; "children were such a
care! always in the way and making no end of trouble if
you took them along, and if you left them at home you
were worried to death lest something should happen to
them."</p>

<p>This was repeated again and again, with slight variations,
till her unwilling listeners would fain have stopped
their ears to the doleful ditty, and Mrs. Nash, quite out
of patience, at length exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Nancy, I should think you'd be afraid to fret so
about your worry with the children, lest Providence
should take them away! I don't deny that it is a good
deal of work and care to nurse and provide for them;
but they're worth it; at least, mine are to me, and there's
nothing worth having in this world that we don't have to
pay for in one way or another. And for my part, I'm
willing to pay for my pleasures and treasures," she added,
clasping her babe fondly to her breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The Nash family also had increased in numbers. Tom
and Billy, now grown great hearty boys, were with their
father in the field, and two little girls sat on the doorstep,
each with a rag doll in her arms, which the busy
mother had found time to make and Miss Nell's skilful
fingers had just finished dressing. The baby boy on
the mother's knee was the last arrival, six months old
and the pet, darling and the treasure of the entire household,
from father down to two-year-old Sallie.</p>

<p>"You never did have any sympathy for me, Sarah,"
whimpered Mrs. Barbour, lifting the corner of her apron
to her eyes. "I wasn't born with such spirits as you
have, and it ain't my fault that I wasn't, and I don't
believe I'm half as stout and strong as you are; and
it's just the same with the children, yours are a great
deal healthier than mine, and that makes it easier for
you in more ways than one. You and Nash don't have
the big doctor bills to pay that we have, and you don't
get all worn out with nursing."</p>

<p>"Well, Nancy," returned her sister-in-law, "maybe I'm
not as sympathizing as I should be; but there is such
a thing as cultivating good spirits and a habit of looking
at the bright side, trusting in the Lord and being content
with what He sends, and that has a good deal to do
with health. Perhaps if your children had a cheerier
mother, they'd have better spirits and better health."</p>

<p>"There it is! I'm always blamed for my misfortunes;
that's just the way Dr. Clendenin talks to me, and
Barbour too, and I think it's a burning shame," sobbed
the abused woman. "I'm sure I wish I was dead and
done with it! and so I shall be one o' these days; and
then perhaps you and Tom will wish you'd treated me a
little better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
"My brother Tom's a very good husband to you,"
remarked Mrs. Nash coolly," and I don't feel conscience
smitten for any abuse I've given you either. It's Bible
doctrine I've been urging on you. It bids us over and
over again to be content, to be free from care, casting it
all on the Lord, to rejoice in the Lord, to be glad in
Him, to rejoice always, to shout for joy.</p>

<p>"And well we may, knowing that life here is short, and
no matter how many troubles we may have they'll soon
be done with and we shall be forever with the Lord;
that is, if we're His children."</p>

<p>Here Nell broke in upon the conversation with a
sudden exclamation. "That cat is acting very
strangely!" and as she spoke the animal came rushing
in from an adjoining wood-shed and dashed wildly
about, gnashing its teeth furiously, its tongue hanging out
and dripping with froth.</p>

<p>Both women sprang up with a scream. "It's mad!
it's mad! it's frothing at the mouth!" Mrs. Nash clutching
her babe in a death like grasp and springing toward
the other children to save them, Mrs. Barbour snatching
her youngest from the floor, while Nell caught up
the next in age and sat it on top of a high old fashioned
bureau, at the same time calling to Flora, who was outside,
to "Run, run! climb a tree or the fence!"</p>

<p>Then seizing a broom she rushed at the cat and drove
it under the bed.</p>

<p>"Oh what'll we do? what'll we do?" shrieked Mrs.
Barbour, the children screaming in chorus. "Why didn't
you drive it out of doors?"</p>

<p>"You run out yourself and take the children with you.
I did the best I could," returned Nell, her voice trembling
with agitation. "You, too, Mrs. Nash, save the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
children and I'll fight the cat. Where's your clothes
line? quick, quick! Oh, I see it!" and snatching it from
the nail where it hung, in a trice she had it opened out
and a noose made in one end.</p>

<p>Then tearing off beds and bed clothes, tumbling them
unceremoniously upon the floor, she mounted the bedstead,
lifted a slat or two from the head, underneath
which the cat crouched, snarling, spitting, foaming, biting
in a frightful manner.</p>

<p>Nell shuddered and shrank back with a cry of terror
as the infuriated animal made a spring at her, but gathering
up all her courage, let down the noose and swung it
slowly to and fro.</p>

<p>A moment of terrified, almost despairing effort, followed
by success, the noose was drawn tight, the rabid
creature lay strangled and dead, and the brave young
girl dropped in a dead faint upon the pile of bedding on
the floor.</p>

<p>The others had obeyed her behest and fled from the
house, leaving her to battle single-handed with the
enraged animal, while they filled the air with cries for
help.</p>

<p>A horseman came at a swift gallop up the road, putting
spurs to his steed as the sounds of distress greeted
his ear.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, drawing rein in front of the
house and springing from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dr. Clendenin, there's a mad cat in the
house, and Miss Nell's trying to kill it!" cried the two
women and Flora in chorus; but the words were scarcely
uttered before he had dashed in at the open door.</p>

<p>His heart leaped into his throat at sight of the prostrate
form on the confused heap of bedding, the body of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
strangled cat so near that the toe of her slipper touched
it.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling!" he exclaimed in low, moved tones
as he sprang to her side.</p>

<p>Then in almost frantic haste he searched for the marks
of the creature's teeth on her hands and arms. There
were none.</p>

<p>He tore off her shoes and stockings, his hands trembling,
his face pale with a terrible fear.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he said at last, drawing a long breath
of relief.</p>

<p>He knelt down, loosened her dress, laid her more comfortably,
her head lower, doing all with exceeding tenderness,
and turning to Mrs. Nash, who had ventured
in after him, leaving her little ones in Mrs. Barbour's
care, said huskily: "Some cold water! quick! quick!
She has fainted."</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, is she hurt?" asked the woman in
tremulous tones, as she hastily handed him a gourd filled
with water from the well bucket.</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment. He was sprinkling
the water upon the still, white face, his own nearly
as colorless. Would she never revive? those sweet
eyes never open again?</p>

<p>Ah, the lids began to quiver, a faint tinge of rose
stole into the fair, softly rounded cheek.</p>

<p>"I hope not," he said with an effort. "It was the
fright probably. A fan, please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash brought one and gave it in silence.</p>

<p>Nell's eyes opened wide, gazing full into his. The
faint tinge on her cheek deepened instantly to crimson,
and starting up in confusion, she hastily stammered out
some incoherent words, and burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
"Lie still for a little, Nell," Kenneth said, gently
forcing her back.</p>

<p>Never were tones more musical with tenderness, never
had eyes spoken a plainer language, and the girl's heart
thrilled with a new, ecstatic joy. For years her hard
but determined task had been to school it to indifference;
but now, now she might let it have its way. He, so noble,
so good, would never deceive her, never wrong her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nell, you are not hurt? not bitten?" exclaimed
Mrs. Nash almost imploringly.</p>

<p>"Hurt? bitten?" repeated Nell, in a half bewildered
way. Then as her eye fell upon the dead cat and the
whole scene came back to her with a rush, "No, no,"
she said, shuddering and hiding her face in her hands;
"it sprang at me, but missed and fell back on the floor,
and at last it ran its head into the noose, jerked away
and strangled, and"&mdash;laughing hysterically&mdash;"I don't
know what happened after that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash knelt down by her side and began putting
on her stockings and shoes.</p>

<p>"The doctor pulled them off to see if you'd got a bite
there," she explained. "Oh I'll never cease to thank the
Lord that you escaped! I feel as if I'd been a mean
coward to run off and leave you to fight the mad thing
all alone. But it wasn't myself I was thinking of, but
the children."</p>

<p>"I know it," murmured Nell, "and I told you to go."</p>

<p>Kenneth had moved away to the farther side of the
room. His face, which was turned from them, was full
of remorseful anguish. Alas! what had he done, won
this dear heart that he dared not claim as his own? Oh,
he had thought the grief, the pain, the loss all his own!
but it was not so, she too must suffer and he could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
save her from it, though for that he would freely lay
down his life.</p>

<p>"Is it dead, have you killed it?" queried Mrs. Barbour
timorously peering in at the open door.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Nash shortly, and stepping in,
followed by the frightened but curious children, Mrs.
Barbour dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, "it's just awful! I'm nearly dead,
was most scared out o' my wits, and shan't get over it
for a month!"</p>

<p>Then catching sight of the dead cat, "Ugh! the
horrid thing! why don't you take it away, some of you?
I feel ready to faint at the very sight of it. Doctor, you'll
have to do something for me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing I can do for you, Mrs. Barbour,"
he said coldly. "You must help yourself, by determined
self-control. After leaving Miss Lamar to face
the living, furious animal alone, you may well bear the
sight of it lying, dead, with all the rest of us here to
share the danger, if there be any."</p>

<p>"There it is, just as usual," she sobbed, "I'm always
blamed no matter what happens. I had my children to
think of."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Nell, sitting up; "it's all over
and nobody hurt."</p>

<p>"Nobody hurt!" was the indignant rejoinder.
"Maybe you ain't, but I am: I've got an awful headache
with the fright, and feel as if I should just die this
minute."</p>

<p>A loud hallo from the road without stopped the torrent
of words for a space.</p>

<p>"Is Dr. Clendenin here?" shouted a man on horseback,
reining in at the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Kenneth stepped quickly to the door.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You're wanted in the greatest kind of a hurry,
doctor; over there in the edge o' the woods, where
they're felling trees, man crushed; not killed, but bad
hurt&mdash;very."</p>

<p>Kenneth was in the saddle before the sentence was
finished, and the two galloped rapidly away.</p>

<p>"People oughtn't to be so careless," commented Mrs.
Barbour, as they all gathered about the door watching
the horsemen till they disappeared in a cloud of dust.
"Why don't they get out of the way when the tree's
going to fall? How quick the doctor went off. He's
ready enough to help a man, but wouldn't do anything
for poor me!"</p>

<p>"He told you what to do for yourself," said her
sister-in-law, a mixture of weariness and contempt in her
tones.</p>

<p>"As if I could! There never was anybody that got
so little sympathy as I do," she fretted, turning from the
door and dropping into her chair again. "But I'll have
another doctor. I'll send for Dr. Buell."</p>

<p>"Dr. Walter Buell; 'Dr. Water Gruel' they call
him," laughed Flora, "because he won't let 'em have
anything hardly to eat. He'll starve you, mother."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Flora," was the angry rejoinder. "I'm not
going to have you laughing at me. You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, poor unfortunate creature that I
am, and your mother too!</p>

<p>"To think that I should have happened here to-day
of all days, when I don't stir from home once in a month!
But that cat wouldn't have gone mad if I hadn't been
here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
But her complaining fell upon inattentive ears. Mrs.
Nash was busy ridding the house of the dead carcass
and setting things in order, and Nell's thoughts were
full of the new joy that had come to her, and of questionings
as to when and where she should again meet
him who had possessed himself of her heart's best affection.
Would he return that evening? Verily she believed
he would.</p>

<p>But no, he did not; and when she went home the
following day, Clare greeted her with the news that Dr.
Clendenin had gone East; he had been suddenly summoned
to Glen Forest by a letter; some one was very ill,
and as a pirogue was just leaving for Cincinnati, he
had taken passage and gone down the river in it.</p>

<p>Nell's cheek paled a trifle and her eyes looked with
mute questioning into those of her sister.</p>

<p>"He left good-by for you," said Clare.</p>

<p>And that was all&mdash;all! The girl's heart seemed to stand
still with pain. What could it mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xi" id="chapter_xi">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The tops of the Alleghanies loomed up darkly against
the eastern sky as it flushed with the rosy hues of a new
day; the delicate shades of rose pink and pale blue
changed to crimson and gold, and anon the increasing
light aroused old Vashti from the heavy slumber into
which she had fallen some hours before.</p>

<p>She started up, rubbed her eyes, and glancing from
the window, muttered, "'Bout time dis chile was wakin'
up and lookin' after tings. Sun's jus' gwine to peep 'bove
dose mountings. Wonder how ole marster is 'bout dis
time?"</p>

<p>She had thrown herself down upon her bed without
undressing. Finishing her remarks with something
between a sigh and a groan, she slowly gathered herself
up and went stumbling from the room, hardly more than
half awake yet, having lost much sleep in the last two or
three weeks.</p>

<p>But reaching the upper chamber where her mistress
had kept solitary vigil through the night, she entered very
quietly, extinguished the candle, drew aside the window
curtains, letting in the morning light and air, then stepping
to the foot of the bed, stood silently gazing upon its
occupant, the big tears stealing down her sable cheeks.</p>

<p>The form lying there was attenuated, the face thin,
haggard, deathly; the sunken eyes were closed, and the
breath came fitfully from the ghastly, parted lips.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenin seemed unconscious of Vashti's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
entrance; her eyes were riveted upon that pallid face,
the cold hand was clasped in hers, and her heart was
sending up agonizing petitions.</p>

<p>They were granted; he stirred slightly, opened his
eyes, looking full into hers with a clear, steady, loving
gaze, while the cold fingers feebly responded to her tender
clasp.</p>

<p>"My wife, my darling!" he whispered, and she bent
eagerly to catch the low breathed words. "God bless
you for your faithful love! I'm going&mdash;going home to be
with Christ; and it's all peace&mdash;peace and light."</p>

<p>The eyelids drooped, the fingers fell away from her
grasp, the breast heaved with one long-drawn sigh, and
all was still.</p>

<p>She fell upon her knees at his side, still with his hand
in hers, her face radiant with unutterable joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank God! thank God!" she cried. "My darling,
my darling! at rest, at rest, and safe at last!"</p>

<p>"Dat he is, dat he is, bress de Lord!" ejaculated the
old negress.</p>

<p>For many minutes the new-made widow knelt there
gazing fixedly into the calm face of the dead; then rising
she gently closed the eyes and composed the limbs of
him who had been to her nearer and dearer than aught
else on earth, not a tear dimming her eyes, but a light
shining in them as in those of one on whom had been
suddenly bestowed an intensely longed for and almost
despaired of boon.</p>

<p>"No strange hands shall busy themselves about thee,
my beloved," she murmured, "mine, only mine shall
make you ready for your quiet, peaceful sleep, 'where
the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at
rest.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Vashti looked on in wonder and surprise, silently
giving such assistance as she might, without waiting for
orders, bringing needed articles and making the room
neat.</p>

<p>At length, the task completed, Vashti went down to her
kitchen, but Mrs. Clendenin lingered still by the side of
the beloved clay, gazing with hungry eyes upon the face
that must soon be hidden from the sight beneath the
clods of the valley.</p>

<p>A light step crossed the threshold and a slight girlish
figure stood beside her. In an instant Marian's arms
were round her mother's neck, her kisses and tears warm
upon her cheek.</p>

<p>"Precious, precious mother! Oh, don't let your heart
break!"</p>

<p>"No, darling!" she whispered, clasping the weeping
girl in her arms; "it is full of joy and thankfulness for
him, for he has laid down his heavy, heavy cross and
received his crown, the crown of righteousness bought
for him with the precious blood of Christ.</p>

<p>"Ah, my Angus, how blest, how blest art thou!" she
cried, bending over the still form and pressing her lips to
the cold brow.</p>

<p>They lingered over him for some minutes, the girl
weeping and sobbing, the mother calm and placid; then
together they went down-stairs and out into the shrubbery.</p>

<p>There were no curious eyes to watch them as they
paced slowly up and down the walks, for the nearest
neighbor was a full half mile away, on the farther side of
the western hills.</p>

<p>The mother talked low and soothingly to her weeping
child, speaking of the glories and bliss of heaven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
and of the loving care of the Lord for His saints on
earth.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother!" cried the girl, "I feared your heart
would break; but instead you seem full of joy!"</p>

<p>"Ah, dear one, life has been a terror to him for many
years; and shall I mourn that he has at last gotten the
victory? That he is gone home to his Father's house,
where there is perfect safety and fulness of joy forever
more?"</p>

<p>"Mother," whispered the girl with a shudder, "what
did he fear? Why have I never been told?"</p>

<p>"Dear child, do not ask! Oh, never ask that!" cried
the mother in a startled tone, and turning a look of
anguish upon her questioner.</p>

<p>The girl's face reflected it.</p>

<p>"Oh, why is it that I am not to be trusted?" she
sobbed, almost wringing her hands in her bitter grief and
distress; "why should I be deemed unworthy of confidence,
even by my own mother? Would I&mdash;". But sobs
choked her utterance.</p>

<p>"My darling, my precious child, it is not that, not
that," faltered the mother, clasping her in her arms with
tender caresses. "But let us speak of this no more, let
us forget his sufferings, as he has forgotten them now.
It is what he would have wished. Shall we not try,
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my poor, dear mother, I will for your sake,"
sobbed the girl. "Ah, if Kenneth were only here!
When will he come?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said Mrs. Clendenin, sighing slightly.
"It is now several weeks since my letter went, but there
are often delays, and it may not have reached him yet.
I think he would start at once on receiving it, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
journey is long and tedious at the best, and there may
be unlooked-for detentions consuming much time, so
that we can hardly expect him for many days to come."</p>

<p>The letter she spoke of was the same that had
caused Kenneth's sudden departure from Chillicothe
only the previous day. A month later he reached Glen
Forest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenin, seated at the open window, saw him
alight at the gate, and hastened out to meet him. There
was a silent embrace, then an earnest scanning by each
of the other's face, noting the changes wrought by time
and the wear and tear of life.</p>

<p>Kenneth's eyes grew misty, for the dear face before
him had aged very much since last he had looked upon
it, and the dark hair had turned to silvery white.</p>

<p>She was regarding him with wistful tenderness.
"Yes," she said, answering his unspoken thought in a
half playful tone, yet smiling through gathering tears,
"I am growing old, and you, my dear boy, are not quite
so young as you were. Come in. Ah, it is good to have
you here, at home again! You have heard, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, since arriving in the neighborhood, but I
knew from your letter that all would be over long before
I could reach you. It was a sore trial to think that even
the small comfort and support of your boy's presence
must be denied you."</p>

<p>"It was all right," she answered in low, sweet tones.
"He was with me who has promised never to leave nor
forsake those who trust in Him."</p>

<p>"I knew He would be, and that was my consolation,"
Kenneth returned in moved tones.</p>

<p>Then glancing about as they entered the house,
"Where is Marian?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
The mother explained that she had gone on an errand
to a neighbor's half a mile away, and would not probably
be back for an hour or more.</p>

<p>Vashti was summoned, bade her young master welcome
with tears of joy, and hastened to set refreshments
before him.</p>

<p>But he did them scant justice. His heart was too full
of contending emotions to allow of much appetite, though
he had not tasted food for some hours.</p>

<p>Gazing upon the loved face he had not seen for years,
listening to the well remembered tones of the dear voice
that had been wont to soothe his childish griefs, to give
the well earned meed of praise which was the highly
prized reward of his boyish efforts to be and do all that
was good, noble, and manly, he forgot to eat.</p>

<p>She had much to tell of all that had occurred in the
family during his absence, but her principal theme was
the sickness and death of her husband.</p>

<p>Kenneth listened with intense, sorrowful interest to
her description of that last scene, and seemed to feel no
surprise when she told of the joy and thankfulness with
which she had parted from her heart's best treasure.</p>

<p>He had risen from the table and drawn a chair to her
side. "Dear mother," he said in faltering accents,
taking her hand in his, "what a life yours has been!
What but the grace of God could have sustained you
through it all!"</p>

<p>"Blessed be His holy name, it has always been sufficient
for me!" she answered. "'Hitherto hath the Lord
helped me,' and I am persuaded that He will help me to
the end."</p>

<p>A moment's silence, which Kenneth was the first to
break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
"Tell me of Marian, mother," he said. "She has
grown? I shall doubtless find her greatly changed."</p>

<p>"More perhaps than you think; the dear child has
shot up into a tall, graceful, blooming girl, very sweet
and lovable, in her mother's eyes at least, with a beauty
that oftentimes makes me tremble for her future.
Kenneth, Kenneth, the child will surely be sought in
marriage, and what shall we do?"</p>

<p>With the last words her voice took on a tone of keen
distress and the eyes she lifted to his were full of
anguish.</p>

<p>"It must not, must not be!" he answered hurriedly,
his brow contracting in a spasm of pain. "Mother,
keep her secluded here with you; let her have no communication
with the other sex, old or young."</p>

<p>"Alas, I fear the utmost vigilance will not prevent it!"
she cried, heaving a deep drawn sigh. "Oh, my darling,
my darling, your mother's heart bleeds for you!"</p>

<p>"Dear mother," he said, again taking her hand and
speaking low and tremulously, "can you not cast this
burden also upon the Lord?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes," she said; "ah, I should die if I could
not! But, Kenneth, what shall we do? Would it not be
better to tell her all&mdash;to warn her in time?"</p>

<p>"Never!" he cried with energy, "it were too
fearful a risk; it might cause the very calamity we so
dread."</p>

<p>"Too true! too true!" she sighed, clasping her hands
in her lap and closing her eyes, while her very lips
grew white.</p>

<p>He bent over her, taking her cold hands in his, repeating
low and tenderly the precious promise, "'When
thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee:
when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be
burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, sweet words, sweet words!" she murmured.
"Lord, increase my faith! But, Kenneth," opening her
eyes and looking up earnestly, entreatingly, as it seemed,
into his face, "you are sure, quite sure that this is the
best, wisest, kindest course? not risking a greater danger
than the one avoided?"</p>

<p>He answered her question with another.</p>

<p>"If we take the other course shall we not be running
into a certain danger in the effort to avoid one that may
never threaten us?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But ah, what a hard choice we must sometimes
make! Yet He knows and will never send one
unneeded pang; will cause all things to work together
for good to them that love Him. May He in His tender
mercy forgive my unbelieving fears!"</p>

<p>Oh, how Kenneth's heart yearned over her, as he gazed
into the dear, patient, sorrowful face, how he felt that
he would willingly give the best years of his life to remove
every thorn from her path! And yet&mdash;and yet, was not
the Love which permitted them to remain, infinitely greater
than his?</p>

<p>Silence again fell between them for a short space.
Then looking tenderly upon him she asked:</p>

<p>"But what of your quest, Kenneth?"</p>

<p>He shook his head sorrowfully. "Nothing yet, absolutely
nothing. Hopes raised now and again but to be
utterly disappointed."</p>

<p>"My poor boy," she sighed, "yours is a heavy cross!
but if borne with steadfast patience your crown of righteousness
will be all the brighter; for our light affliction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory."</p>

<p>He looked at her with glistening eyes. "Yes," he
said, with a slight huskiness in his voice, "and even in
this life it may be lightened."</p>

<p>"I fear not," she answered in gentle, pitying tones.
"So many years have now passed there seems little hope
that she yet lives, and even if she does, if she should be
found, there may be nothing gained."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," he returned with emotion, and rising
to pace the room, "and yet there are times when hope is
still strong within me."</p>

<p>At that instant a slight, graceful, girlish figure came
swiftly into the room, and with a glad cry, "Kenneth,
Kenneth, you have come at last!" Marian threw herself
into the manly arms joyfully opened to receive her.</p>

<p>She clung about his neck weeping from very excess of
happiness. "Oh, I have wanted you so much, so
much!" she cried. "I thought you would never come!
I wish you would never go away again."</p>

<p>He folded her close to his heart with tenderest caresses,
then held her off that he might gaze into her blooming
face, drinking in its loveliness with feelings of mingled
joy and anguish.</p>

<p>It was and yet was not the little pet sister he had left
when he went away; she stood on the verge of womanhood
now, innocent and fair, with a sweet blending of
childish and womanly graces.</p>

<p>Ah, must that deadly curse fall on her? He shuddered
at the thought, and almost groaned aloud.</p>

<p>She saw the pain in his face, and redoubling her
caresses, "What is it, Kenneth?" she asked; "my poor
Kenneth, you are not happy. Has some one been unkind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
to you? Ah, I know," she added quickly, in a lower
tone, "it is for poor, dear father you are grieving; but
you know he is so, so happy now, while here he was
always sad and suffering."</p>

<p>He sat down and drew her to the old seat upon his
knee. The mother had left the room and they were
quite alone for the moment.</p>

<p>"How long since you sat here last!" he said, "and
how glad I am to have you in the old place again."</p>

<p>And truly he was, yet peradventure not entirely for her
own sake. To hold this sweet young creature close, to
pet and caress her to his heart's content, was it not some
slight relief to the longing desire to embrace that other
one who was dearer still?</p>

<p>Had his thoughts some magnetic influence upon
Marian's that led her, the next instant, to look up in his
face and ask for news of "that pretty Miss Lamar"?</p>

<p>"What do you know of her, little one?" he asked
gently smoothing the shining hair, conscious of the tell-tale
blood mounting to his forehead, but avoiding the
curious gaze of the soft, bright eyes.</p>

<p>"I saw her in church the Sunday before you left, and
thought her very sweet and pretty. And do you know,
Kenneth," giving him a hug and an arch, bewitching
smile, "it's all my own notion and I never told anybody
before, but I've had a sort of presentiment that some day
you would make her my sister. Ah, I've always wanted a
sister so much! But oh, Kenneth, I didn't mean to pain
you!" she cried, noting the expression of his face.
"Please forgive me and I'll never mention it again."</p>

<p>"Don't, darling!" he said hoarsely. "Marriage is not
for me. I can not tell you why," as he read the question
in her eyes; "but," with a strange, forced smile, "I want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
my little sister always to lay her plans to devote herself
to the dear mother while she lives, and if it should please
God to take her away first, then to come to be the light
and joy of her bachelor brother's home."</p>

<p>She half withdrew herself from his arms, her features
working with contending emotions.</p>

<p>"What is it, little sister? Do you not love me? do
you not want to share my home?" he asked soothingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you know I love you; you know I'll be glad
to be always near you," she cried, flinging her arms about
his neck; then hiding her face on his breast in a burst of
passionate weeping, "But why do you and mother have
secrets from me, family secrets, as if I were not worthy
to be trusted?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my little sister, be content with your ignorance!"
he said in moved tones, drawing her closer to him. "Can
you doubt that we love you well enough to tell you all if
it would add to your happiness?"</p>

<p>"But I want to know," she sobbed. "If there is
trouble or sorrow I ought to bear my share. Do you
think I could be so selfish as not to prefer to do it?"</p>

<p>"No, dear sister, I believe you bear a very unselfish
love to your mother and brother, and, therefore, I am
sure you will not distress them by refusing to trust to
their judgment of what is best in regard to those things.
Believe me, the knowledge you crave could bring you
nothing but grief and anguish. It is all it has brought
me. The day may come when you must be told, but do
not try to hasten it. I can be here but a short time to
arrange matters for mother and you, and while I stay let
us try to be happy."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes!" she cried, clinging to him and weeping
afresh. "Kenneth, Kenneth, why can't we have you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
always? I'll try to be content not to know anything;
but just tell me one thing: Why do you search for a
white woman among the Indians? I've learned from
some of your letters about your long journeys in
the wilderness, why are you so anxious to find her,
so grieved when you fail? Surely I may know that, may
I not?"</p>

<p>He considered a moment. "Yes," he sighed, "if you
insist upon it I will tell you, though I know you will
regret having asked, for the knowledge can bring you
only sorrow. Shall I tell you?"</p>

<p>She gave an eager assent; but at that moment the
mother returned to the room, and he whispered in
Marian's ear that they would defer it until another time.</p>

<p>Some days later, a fitting opportunity presenting itself,
she hastened to claim the fulfilment of his promise; but
when he answered the question she burst into bitter
weeping, crying as she clung about his neck, "Oh, Kenneth,
Kenneth, why did you tell me, why did I ask? I
wish I had not!" and he had much ado to comfort her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xii" id="chapter_xii">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The episode of the mad cat had given a severer shock
to Nell's nerves than she was at all aware of at the time.
The joy and the new-born hope that sprang to life within
her in meeting that look of ineffable tenderness in Kenneth's
eyes buoyed her up at first, but the news of his
sudden departure, leaving neither note nor message for
her, was a heavy blow, and brought on the natural reaction
from the excitement of her struggle with the rabid
animal.</p>

<p>For days her prostration was so great that she could
do little but lie on her bed, and when alone often
bemoaned herself with bitter sighing and weeping,
although in Clare's presence she constantly assumed a
cheerfulness she was far from feeling, yet that deceived
even that keen-eyed individual.</p>

<p>At length her woman's pride helped her to rally her
failing energies. She rose from her bed and went about
her accustomed duties and pleasures with a determined
will to seem her old self; hiding her well-nigh breaking
heart behind a smiling countenance.</p>

<p>She learned from Dale that Kenneth's summons had
been to the dying bed of his father, and that though he
could not hope to traverse the intervening distance in
season to witness the closing scene, he yet felt it imperative
upon him to make all haste to give his widowed
mother the comfort and support of his presence at the
earliest possible moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
"Ah, he had no time to write before leaving!" thought
Nell; and hope whispered that he would perhaps do so
from some station on the way, or from Glen Forest
immediately on his arrival there.</p>

<p>She waited and watched, now hopefully, now with
feverish longing, and anon in almost utter despair, as
weeks dragged on their weary round, bringing no word
from him, no evidence that she was not completely forgotten.</p>

<p>She grew absent-minded, and would catch herself
sitting in listless attitude, silent and abstracted, while
others chatted and laughed gaily at her side; or moving
about with a languor that attracted Clare's attention, and
brought upon her vexatious questions and remarks.</p>

<p>"What was the matter? She was certainly not well,
for it was not like her to be so dull. She was losing her
appetite too. She should take more out-door exercise.
Why did she stay in the house so constantly of late?
Where would she like to go? What was there that she
could eat? Really she must try to keep up, if only till
Dr. Clendenin returned, for he was the only physician
in the place in whom the major felt any confidence."</p>

<p>Nell answered, not always in the most amiable of tones,
that she was perfectly well and did not know why people
should persist in believing otherwise. She was in no
haste for Dr. Clendenin's return, and hoped he would
stay six months or a year if he felt inclined to do so.</p>

<p>Still, spite of her protestations, she continued to grow
pale and thin, ate less and less, and at last was forced to
take to her bed with a low, nervous fever.</p>

<p>It was now far on in October, but Kenneth had not
returned, and Dr. Buell was called in by the major, much
against the patient's will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
"I don't want him or his medicines," she said. "I'm
not sick."</p>

<p>"Why, what nonsense!" said Clare; "why do you lie
here if you are not ill?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm tired, tired!" sighed the girl, turning
away her head. "I only need rest, and all I want is to
be let alone."</p>

<p>"The fact is, you don't know what ails you or what you
need; and you're not going to be let alone," remarked
Clare, with the assumption of authority always so distasteful
to her young sister-in-law.</p>

<p>The words, but especially the tone, brought the color
to Nell's cheeks and an indignant light into her eyes.</p>

<p>She opened her lips to reply, but Clare had already left
the room, and the next moment re-entered it, bringing
Dr. Buell with her.</p>

<p>His remedies had no good effect. Nell drooped more
and more. Major Lamar became extremely anxious
and uneasy.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said to his wife again and again, "that
Clendenin would come home. It is very unfortunate
that he should be absent just now."</p>

<p>"Doesn't any body hear from him?" she asked, hearing
the remark for perhaps the fiftieth time.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll go and ask Dale," he answered,
taking up his hat and hurrying from the house.</p>

<p>He had not gone a hundred yards when he espied&mdash;welcome
sight!&mdash;Kenneth himself walking briskly toward
him.</p>

<p>They met with a hearty handshaking and words of
cordial greeting.</p>

<p>"Come at last," said the major, "and just when you
are sorely needed. I believe in my heart Nell's in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
dangerous condition, and Buell's doing her no good. I
must take you home with me at once."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No but about it," interrupted the major bluntly. "He
was called in with the distinct understanding that the
moment you returned the case would be put into your
hands, you being the family physician."</p>

<p>Kenneth made no further objection, but went with his
friend, asking a few hurried questions by the way in
regard to the nature of the malady and the length of
time that had elapsed since the patient's seizure.</p>

<p>Nell, lying alone on her bed, heard the well-known step
and voice in the outer room. What a thrill the sounds
sent through her whole frame, making every nerve tingle
with excitement!</p>

<p>She half started up, flushing and trembling, then as
step and voice drew nearer, fell back again, closed her
eyes and hid her face in the bed clothes.</p>

<p>"Nell, are you ready to see the doctor?" asked Clare's
voice at the door.</p>

<p>"No, nor ever shall be. I should think that you and
Percy might be convinced by this time that his visits are
doing me no good," answered the girl, in a tone of
irritation.</p>

<p>"But it's Dr. Clendenin this time, Nell," said Clare,
stepping aside and motioning him to enter.</p>

<p>Nell lay perfectly still and kept her eyes shut, resolved
to appear utterly indifferent to his presence; but hers was
a tell-tale face to him; he saw that the indifference was
only assumed, yet failed to fully understand it.</p>

<p>"I grieve to find you so ill," he said, bending over her,
and speaking in the tone of extreme gentleness and compassion
that ever touched her heart to its inmost core.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
She resented it, she did not want to have any kindly
feeling toward him; she was determined she would not,
so averting her face, answered, almost rudely, that she
was not very ill, and would do well enough if she could
only be left alone; then unable through weakness to maintain
her self-control, burst into a fit of hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>"You see she's dreadfully nervous, doctor," remarked
Clare, a little maliciously, for she knew that Nell could
not endure the imputation.</p>

<p>"Tears will bring some relief; I will be in again in
the course of an hour," said Kenneth, and was gone
almost before he had finished his sentence.</p>

<p>When he came again he found his patient more composed,
but the pale, sunken cheeks, and the great, hollow
eyes filled him with remorse and anxiety; he could
scarcely command his voice for a moment.</p>

<p>"Excuse my rudeness, doctor," she said, holding out
a thin white hand. "I believe I'm just sick enough to
be very cross."</p>

<p>She had resolved not to look at him, but, as she spoke,
involuntarily raised her eyes to his and read there such
yearning affection, such tender compassion as caused
her to drop them instantly, while the hot blood dyed
cheek and brow, but only to vanish again, leaving them
paler than before.</p>

<p>And he? A wild impulse, scarcely to be restrained,
seized him to catch her in his arms, fold her to his heart,
and pour out the story of his love.</p>

<p>The desire was so overpowering that it may be he
would have yielded to it had not the major's entrance at
that instant prevented.</p>

<p>But Nell had read the look, and the sweet story it told
was as a cordial to her fainting spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
She rallied from that moment, the next day he found
her sitting up, and in a week she was able to drive out.</p>

<p>After that his visits, which had been but few and brief
from the first, were rarer and shorter still, and soon they
ceased entirely.</p>

<p>She seldom saw him now, except at church or on the
street, when they would exchange a passing bow and
smile, and yet he had not told the story of his love, save
with his eloquent eyes.</p>

<p>But she blamed herself for that; for with the strange
inconsistency of human nature, she had shrunk from
being left alone with him, studiously avoiding giving him
an opportunity to speak the words for which her very
soul was hungering and thirsting.</p>

<p>During all this time Wawillaway had been a frequent
visitor at the house of Major Lamar, coming often to
Chillicothe with baskets of his own weaving for sale, and
never failing to call upon these friends who had made
much of him ever since his signal service to Nell.</p>

<p>When he remained over night in the town it was
usually as their guest, sleeping on the kitchen floor,
wrapped in his blanket, and with his feet to the fire.</p>

<p>He was an especial favorite with Nell, and the liking
was mutual, he having a great admiration for the "white
squaw" whom he had saved from the panther's teeth and
claws, while she felt that she owed him a debt of lasting
gratitude; a debt that was doubled by an occurrence
that took place some months subsequent to her recovery
from her late illness.</p>

<p>Mounting Fairy one bright spring morning, she sallied
forth with the intention of paying a visit to her friend
Mrs. Nash.</p>

<p>Wild animals were now seldom seen in the vicinity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the town, and she felt secure in taking a short ride without
escort; but on the way found herself confronted by
danger of another kind which she had not taken into
account.</p>

<p>She was passing through a bit of woods, when a man
suddenly sprang from behind a tree, seized her bridle,
bringing her pony to an abrupt halt that had nearly
thrown her from the saddle, and with a lecherous,
impudent stare into her face, and a demoniacal grin, said:</p>

<p>"I'm powerful glad o' this meetin'; ben a wantin' to
scrape acquaintance this long while; fur you're a mighty
purty gal."</p>

<p>Nell's cheek blanched and an involuntary shiver of
fear crept over her.</p>

<p>The man was a tall, broad shouldered, powerfully
built fellow, of the border ruffian class, whom she had
seen about the streets and in the stores of the town a
number of times in the last few months.</p>

<p>She knew little of him except his name, which seemed
to her strangely appropriate, such was the ferocious and
animal expression of his bronzed and bearded face.</p>

<p>She had felt instinctive loathing of the man from the
first casual glance at him, had seen his evil eyes more
than once following her furtively with a look that filled
her with a nameless terror; and it may well be imagined
that she was now filled with affright at this unexpected
encounter in the lonely wood.</p>

<p>A conciliatory course seemed wisest, and with a heroic
effort to hide her alarm, she addressed him politely.</p>

<p>"I am in haste, Mr. Wolf; please be good enough not
to detain me."</p>

<p>"Not yet, my beauty, can't let you go just yet; we'll
have a little chat first. Come, I'll help you to 'light, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
we'll go and sit together a spell on that log yonder," he
said, taking hold of her left arm.</p>

<p>"Unhand me! how dare you?" she cried, her cheeks
crimson, her eyes flashing with indignation, and bringing
her riding whip down on his hand with all the force she
could muster.</p>

<p>The stinging blow made him release her for an instant,
but he kept his hold on the bridle, and an attempt
on her part to urge her pony forward only made the
creature rear and plunge in a dangerous manner.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" cried the ruffian with a derisive
laugh; and uttering a fearful oath, he threw his arm
about her waist and had nearly lifted her from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Help! help!" she shrieked wildly till the woods rang
again with the sound, and striking madly at him with the
whip.</p>

<p>She was answered instantly by the Indian warwhoop
close at hand, and half a dozen savages, armed with
rifles and tomahawks, sprang out from the wood, not a
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Wolf, having left his gun leaning up against a tree at
some little distance, was unarmed except the hunting
knife in his belt, and seeing himself about to be overpowered
by numbers, fled with the utmost precipitation,
plunging into the forest and instantly disappearing in its
depths.</p>

<p>Nell, not knowing whether to look upon the red men
as friends or foes, felt her heart leap into her mouth,
expecting to be tomahawked and scalped on the spot;
but the next moment, recognizing in the foremost warrior
her friend Wawillaway, she uttered a cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Very bad white man," he said coming up to her,
"want killee you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
"No, I hope not," she said carefully steadying her
voice, "but I am so glad, so glad you came and drove
him away, Wawillaway. Oh, you have done me a greater
service to-day than even the killing of the panther!"
she added with an irrepressible shudder.</p>

<p>It was long before Nell ventured again beyond the
limits of the town without a protector; but fearing Wolf's
vengeance upon her brother, should he bring the ruffian
to punishment, as he undoubtedly would should he hear
of this day's peril to her, she carefully concealed the
occurrence, exacting a promise from her Indian friend
to do the same.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xiii" id="chapter_xiii">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>At about the same time that Nell Lamar met with her
adventure with Wolf, important events were transpiring
at Glen Forest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenin was summoned away to a distance
from home by the serious illness of a sister of her late
husband. Ignorant of the precise nature of the disease,
she was unwilling to expose Marian to it, and though
almost equally reluctant to leave her behind, decided
upon that as the safer course.</p>

<p>So with much tender, motherly counsel bestowed upon
this child of her love, and many an injunction to Vashti
to watch over her darling, she took her departure.</p>

<p>The young girl felt inexpressibly lonely without the
mother who had been to her friend, teacher and almost
sole companion, everything in one, for they had led a
very secluded life, paying and receiving few visits; indeed,
seldom going anywhere but to church, except that
Marian took many a ramble and many a ride on her
pony through the adjacent woods and over the nearer
hills, usually unaccompanied save by Caius, a huge mastiff
who had hitherto proved a most efficient protector.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenin had indeed never been neglectful of
the Christian duty of ministering to the sick and suffering
so far as lay in her power, and Marian was in this
regard following in her mother's footsteps.</p>

<p>A mile away over the eastern hills lived two elderly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
maiden ladies, Esther and Janet Burns, the one a paralytic,
the other feeble and nearly blind from cataract.</p>

<p>They had a farm, the rent of which yielded them a support,
but their lives were lonely, and Marian's visits were
a great boon.</p>

<p>She had fallen into the habit of going over almost
daily to Woodland, as their place was called, and spending
an hour in reading to them from the works of one or
another of her favorite authors.</p>

<p>The Clendenins had been for generations great lovers
of books, and the library at Glen Forest, though what
would be considered small and of little value in these
days, was large and select compared with those of their
neighbors.</p>

<p>Marian continued her visits to Woodland after her
mother had gone, and, because she found it so much less
lonely there than at home, sometimes lingered half the
day, to the great content of the Misses Burns.</p>

<p>They would gladly have induced her to take up her
abode with them during her mother's absence, but to that
she would by no means consent; home was home after all,
and though it might be pleasant to spend a part of the
day elsewhere, when night came she wanted to be in her
own familiar room, with old Vashti within call.</p>

<p>On Sunday Marian always attended service in the little
country church spoken of in a former chapter.</p>

<p>The neighborhood was a very quiet one, few coming
or going, the same faces showing themselves in the
sanctuary Sunday after Sunday, and the sight of a new
one was always a source of no little interest; it may
therefore be supposed that the advent among them, a
week after Mrs. Clendenin set out on her journey, of a
fine looking young man, a total stranger, well dressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
and of serious and gentlemanly deportment, created
some little stir and excitement; especially among the
younger portion of the congregation.</p>

<p>He sat in the pew of Mr. George Grimes, who kept
the nearest inn, the sign of the Stag and Hounds, and
the services had not been over many minutes before
every one knew that he had engaged board there for a
month, and that he was an Englishman, apparently
wealthy, having brought a valet with him.</p>

<p>The congregation had passed out into the churchyard,
and a subdued hum of voices exchanging neighborly
greetings and inquiries after each other's health,
mingled pleasantly with the twittering of birds, the sighing
of the wind through the forest, and the low murmur
of the stream on the farther side of the road.</p>

<p>The stranger stood aside, looking on and listening
with a well bred air of kindly interest.</p>

<p>"Who is that, Grimes?" he asked, his eye following
admiringly a graceful girlish figure as it tripped past
them down the path that led out to the road where the
horses were tied, and, with the assistance of one of the
young men, who stepped eagerly forward to give it,
sprang lightly into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Miss Marian Clendenin, of Glen Forest, Mr. Lyttleton:
one of the prettiest young ladies in the county, if
I'm a judge o' beauty," replied Grimes, lifting his hat to
the fair girl.</p>

<p>"She sits her horse well," remarked the stranger, still
following her with his eyes as she cantered away in the
direction of her home, Caius bounding nimbly on by the
pony's side. "But she seems quite alone, is there no
more of the family?"</p>

<p>"Most of 'em lie yonder," replied Grimes, pointing to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
row of graves not far from the spot where they stood.
"Children all died young but this girl and an older
brother who went West years ago. Father died within
the last year, and the mother's away nursing a sick sister,
I hear."</p>

<p>Lyttleton seemed interested, asked several more
questions, walked over to the graves and carefully read the
inscriptions on the tombstones; Grimes standing by his
side and going on with much garrulity to tell all he knew
or had ever heard of the family, and that was not a
little, for he was a great gatherer and retailer of news,
for which few had better opportunities.</p>

<p>He spoke of the late Mr. Clendenin as a man of
singularly secluded habits, upright and honest in all his
dealings, but strangely averse to the society of his kind.</p>

<p>"And I suppose," he added, "that's what has kept his
wife and daughter pretty much shut up at home:
at any rate the girl's never seen at a cornhusking
or quilting, or any sort o' merry making, and
the young fellows never get a chance to wait on her.
About the only place she does go to is Woodland, to
read to those poor sickly old ladies; but she's there
every day I'm told."</p>

<p>"She is then of a literary turn, this young heroine of
yours?" sneered the stranger interrogatively.</p>

<p>"That's just what she is, sir, so I've heard on good
authority, they're a bookish family." And as they rode
homeward Grimes went on to expatiate at length upon
Marian's reputed literary tastes and acquirements.</p>

<p>"You are a good trumpeter," remarked Lyttleton.
"Pray tell me, are the Clendenins wealthy?"</p>

<p>"Glen Forest's a valuable place, and there's only the
two of them, as I told you, after the mother dies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
"And the son doesn't get it all, as is usually the way
with us?"</p>

<p>"No: and I dare say there's money laid by, too."</p>

<p>The next afternoon Marian, reading to her friends in
the wide, cool porch that ran along the front of the
house at Woodland, saw a horseman coming leisurely
along the road, as, looking up from her book, she sent a
casual glance in that direction.</p>

<p>"It is the English gentleman," she said in a low tone,
as he drew rein at the gate.</p>

<p>It was long since either Esther or Janet Burns had
been able to go to church, and Monday's visit from
Marian was anticipated with even more than ordinary
eagerness because of the detailed account she would
bring of all she had seen and heard the previous day.
Of course she had not, on this occasion, omitted to
mention the stranger in Grimes's pew.</p>

<p>"Where, my dear?" asked purblind Janet, straining
her eyes in a vain effort to see him. "Is he riding? I
surely heard horse's hoofs."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he is alighting at the gate," said her sister.
"What can he want here? Marian, child, will you call
Kitty to see what he wishes?"</p>

<p>"I'se here, missus," the girl answered for herself,
coming round the corner of the house. "What do you
want, sah?" hurrying down the path to meet the
approaching stranger.</p>

<p>"I am very thirsty and would be thankful for a glass
of milk or cold water, my good woman," he answered,
lifting his hat to the ladies.</p>

<p>At that Miss Janet stepped forward and hospitably
invited him to come in and rest himself for
a little, remarking that the day was very sultry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
he must have found the heat of the sun very oppressive.</p>

<p>"I have indeed, madame," he said, accepting the
offered kindness with alacrity, and stealing a glance of
mingled curiosity and admiration at the fresh, blooming
face of the young girl guest. "I think the sun shines
with a fiercer heat here than in Europe, and if I do not
intrude shall be very glad to rest in this shady nook
until he approaches somewhat nearer his setting."</p>

<p>Both the sisters assured him he was welcome, and
Kitty was directed to bring a glass of morning's milk
and some home-made cake for his refreshment.</p>

<p>The Misses Burns were good, simple-minded, unsuspicious
women, Lyttleton an accomplished man of the
world, thoroughly unscrupulous and selfish, but able,
when it suited his purpose, as it did on this occasion, to
conceal his true character by polished manners and a
most pleasing and insinuating address.</p>

<p>He was a fluent talker and knew how to adapt his conversation
to those with whom he was thrown, in whatever
station in life.</p>

<p>He addressed the older ladies almost exclusively, but
his eyes continually sought Marian's face, which glowed
with interest and intelligence.</p>

<p>He stayed for more than an hour, and made himself
so entertaining that they were sorry to see him go, and
gave him a pressing invitation to come again, which he
readily promised to do.</p>

<p>With thanks for their hospitality and a courteous
adieu, he at last took his departure.</p>

<p>"A very fine-looking, intelligent and well-bred gentleman,"
remarked Miss Esther, as man and horse disappeared
down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
"He has evidently been accustomed to good society,"
added her sister, "has travelled a great deal and knows
how to describe what he has seen; but while he talked
to us, his eyes sought Marian's face for the most part."</p>

<p>"Surely that was but natural, seeing how much
younger and fairer than ours it is," Miss Esther said,
with a pleased smile and an affectionate, admiring
glance at the now blushing maiden. "I am sure she makes
a pretty picture sitting there under the drooping vines,
with Caius crouching at her feet."</p>

<p>"How did you like him Marian, dear?" asked Miss
Janet; "my dim eyes cannot judge whether he is as
comely as Esther says."</p>

<p>"I do not think him quite so handsome as Kenneth,"
Marian answered with some hesitation, "he doesn't look
so good and noble and true. But," she added quickly,
the color deepening on her cheek, "I do not know him
well enough yet to judge of his character, and he talks
very well. Now shall we go on with our reading? I can
only stay to finish the chapter, for you see the sun is
getting low."</p>

<p>Lyttleton, as he rode briskly on toward his temporary
home, was saying to himself, with an evil smile, "A
pretty girl, very young, hardly sixteen I should say, and
as innocent as a child; I flatter myself 'twill be no difficult
task to win her confidence and learn all she knows.
How much that may be I have yet to discover."</p>

<p>Determined to make diligent use of his opportunities,
he became from that time a daily visitor at Woodland,
and so conducted himself as to win the entire confidence
of all three ladies, and cause them to look upon his visits
as a great treat.</p>

<p>He had travelled much and had many adventures to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
relate, and stores of information to impart in regard to
the strange lands he had seen. He had spent some
weeks in Paris during the late Revolution, had witnessed
the execution of Marie Antoinette and of many of the
nobility, and had had some narrow escapes of his own;
all of which he described to his little audience with thrilling
effect.</p>

<p>Often, too, he brought a book in his pocket, usually
Shakespeare's works, Milton's Paradise Lost, or some
other poem, from which he would read passages in
a rich, mellow voice so exquisitely modulated that it
seemed to double the beauty of the author's words.</p>

<p>Marian's soul was full of poetry, and she would listen
like one enchanted, her eyes shining, her lips slightly
apart, her breathing almost suspended lest she should
lose a single word or tone.</p>

<p>Lyttleton, without seeming to do so, noted it all with
secret delight.</p>

<p>After a little he fell into the habit of accompanying
her on her homeward ride or walk, whichever it might
be, and of meeting her in her rambles, thus gradually
placing himself on a footing of intimacy.</p>

<p>And Marian had forgotten her first intuitive perception
of his character; his charms of person and manner
had come to exert a strange fascination over her; she
thought of neither the past nor the future when he was
by her side, but lived only in the blissful present, while
he saw and exulted in his power.</p>

<p>He made no open declaration of love, but when they
were alone in the silent woods it breathed in every look
and tone, filling the innocent girlish heart with a strange,
exquisite, tremulous happiness.</p>

<p>Caius, always by her side, or crouching at her feet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
was the sole witness of these interviews, and Marian
could not bring herself to speak of them even to her two
old friends, who, in their guilelessness, had no thought of
harm to her from the daily intercourse of which they were
cognizant.</p>

<p>Sometimes Lyttleton drew her on to talk of herself,
her home, her absent brother, and asked many questions
in regard to him, which Marian answered readily because
it was a pleasure to speak of Kenneth.</p>

<p>She was eager in his praise, she would have delighted
to show him to her new friend.</p>

<p>"You and he were both born at Glen Forest?"
Lyttleton one day remarked, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No; only I," Marian said, a slightly troubled look
coming into her eyes; "I and the brothers and sisters
who died very young. Kenneth is many years older,
and it was when he was a babe that my parents came
here to live."</p>

<p>"Ah? and where did they live before that? where
was Kenneth born?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere in eastern Tennessee; I cannot tell you
exactly, for there was no town, no settlement, just my
father's cabin in a little clearing he had made in the
forest, and another, a neighbor's, half a mile away."</p>

<p>Marian spoke hastily, with half-averted face and a perceptible
shudder.</p>

<p>"Why that shudder, my sweet girl?" he asked, gently
pressing her hand, which he had taken in his.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the terrible occurrence that led my
father and mother to abandon the spot," she said in low,
tremulous tones; "an attack by the Indians in which
several were killed. It is scarcely ever alluded to in the
family and I never heard the full particulars."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
"Then we will speak no more of it," he said, and
began to talk of other things.</p>

<p>Some days later they were again alone together; they
had been climbing the hills till quite weary, and were
now resting, seated side by side upon a fallen tree,
within sight of Glen Forest, the pretty mountain stream
that flowed past it singing and dancing almost at their
very feet.</p>

<p>Marian had her lap full of wild flowers which she was
arranging in a bouquet, Lyttleton watching her with a
curious smile on his lips, glancing now at the deft-fingers,
now at the glowing cheeks.</p>

<p>She looked very pretty, very sweet and innocent; she
had thrown off her hat and the dark brown curls fell in
rich masses over neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>Caius, upon her other side, seemed to be keeping
jealous watch over her, regarding Lyttleton with something
of a distrust she did not share; she had perhaps
never been so happy before in all her short life.</p>

<p>Neither had spoken for several minutes, when Lyttleton,
leaning over, said softly, "Do you know, pretty
one, that I leave you to-day?"</p>

<p>Marian dropped her flowers and looked up with a start,
her cheek paling, and her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"Shall you be sorry to see me go?" he asked tenderly,
taking her hand and pressing it to his lips.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell, her lip quivered, one bright drop rolled
quickly down her cheek. It was a rude awaking from
her blissful dream.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did you come at all," she sobbed, "if you
must go away again? and so soon!"</p>

<p>She did not see his exultant smile.</p>

<p>"Why you know I must go," he said, "since my home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
is not here; but I am very glad I came, as otherwise I
should never have known you, my pretty darling, the
very sweetest, the dearest little girl I ever saw;" he bent
fondly over her and touched his lips to her forehead.</p>

<p>But she shrank from the caress, her cheek crimsoning.</p>

<p>"No, no; you must not do that. I&mdash;I cannot
allow it."</p>

<p>"But why not? Why should we not be kind and
affectionate to each other? Ah, don't move away from
me, don't avert your sweet face, or I shall think you
quite hate me, and I am going away to-day."</p>

<p>She covered her face with her hands to hide the tears
that would come, and struggled with the sobs that were
half choking her.</p>

<p>All the brightness seemed to have suddenly gone
out of her life. "Why had she let herself care for him
when he was going away and would never, never come
again?"</p>

<p>"Don't weep, sweet girl, dear Marian; it breaks my
heart to see your tears, my own darling," he murmured
low and tenderly, moving nearer and venturing to steal
an arm about her waist; "and yet there is a strange
pleasure in the pain, because they show that you are
not wholly indifferent to me, that you have yielded to
me at least one small corner of your precious little heart.
Is it not so, dearest?"</p>

<p>Surely this was the language of love, and her heart
leaped up with joy in the midst of her pain. She did
not repulse him now, but let him draw her head to a
resting place on his shoulder and kiss away her tears.</p>

<p>"Don't shed any more, vein of my heart!" he
whispered, "for I will return to you, perhaps in a few
months, certainly within a year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
"Oh, will you?" she cried, smiling through the tears,
lifting her eyes for an instant to his to meet a gaze so
ardent that she dropped them again, while a crimson
tide swept over face and neck.</p>

<p>The sun had touched the western hilltops, and the
trees cast long shadows at their feet, when at last they
rose and moved slowly on in the direction of Glen Forest.</p>

<p>He would not go in, and they parted at the gate with
a long tender embrace.</p>

<p>"Do not forget me, sweet Marian; I will come again,"
he repeated.</p>

<p>"No, no, never! I shall never forget!" she sobbed,
"but, you, you will forget me when you are far away
and meet other and prettier girls."</p>

<p>"I have seen thousands, but never one half so lovely
or half so sweet," he whispered, as for the last time he
snatched a kiss from the rich red lips.</p>

<p>He was gone, hidden from her by the windings of the
road, and Marian hurried up the path to the house, sat
down on the porch step, and with her arms round the
neck of her faithful dog, her cheek resting on his head,
wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>Old Vashti found her thus.</p>

<p>"What de mattah, chile?" she asked, "you didn't hear
no bad news?"</p>

<p>Marian shook her head. "I'm so lonely!" she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"Well dat's bad nuff, chile, but don't fret yo' heart out
dat way; de missus come back soon, please de Lawd;
so cheer up, honey, and come and eat yo' suppah. I'se
cooked a chicken and made some o' dose muffins you's
so fond of."</p>

<p>But Marian was destined to be more lonely still. Sad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
news reached Glen Forest the next morning just as she
was preparing to pay her usual visit to Woodland. Miss
Janet, in her blindness, had missed her footing at the top
of the stairs and fallen down the whole flight, striking
her head with such force that she was taken up insensible,
and in a few minutes had ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>The shock of the terrible accident brought a second
stroke of paralysis upon the bereaved sister, and in a
few days they were lying side by side in the little churchyard.
They had been lovely and pleasant in their lives,
and in death were not divided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xiv" id="chapter_xiv">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>One beautiful October day two well-mounted gentlemen,
each followed by a servant, came galloping into
Chillicothe, and halted at Major Lamar's door.</p>

<p>In the one the major instantly recognized an old friend
and companion in arms, Captain Bernard, now a wealthy
Virginia planter; the other was introduced as an English
gentleman, Mr. Lysander Lyttleton, his guest for some
weeks, whom he had persuaded to accompany him on a
visit to this new state, of whose beauty and fertility they
had heard the most flattering accounts.</p>

<p>The major gave them a hearty welcome, and proffered
the hospitalities of his house, a larger and more commodious
dwelling than the one he had occupied at the
beginning of our story. Tig was summoned to take
charge of the servants and horses, and the major himself
conducted his guests to the parlor and introduced them
to his wife and sister.</p>

<p>Dinner was already on the table; two more plates were
added and they sat down to partake of the meal, but
while in the act of taking their places their number was
augmented by a new arrival, a very plainly dressed,
sober looking man, who came in with the air of one who
felt quite at home, giving and receiving a cordial greeting.</p>

<p>"Ah, Tommy," said the major, shaking hands with
him, "you are just in time. Tig, set up a chair and
bring another plate for Mr. Dill."</p>

<p>Having been introduced in due form to the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
guests, and requested to ask a blessing, the new comer
bowed his head over his plate, each one present copying
his example, and with outspread hands and closed eyes,
poured out a long prayer of fervent thanksgiving for the
food set before them, and all other blessings temporal
and spiritual, mingled with much humble confession of
sin, and very many petitions; winding up with this
remarkable one: "O Lord, we beseech thee to go into
the highways and byways and hedges of our hearts and
drive out the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the
Amorites, and the Jebusites."</p>

<p>The elders of the family preserved a grave and decorous
silence to the end, which the guests and the children
had some difficulty in doing; the latter, especially the
little boys, being almost convulsed with suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p>At length the Amen was pronounced, Mrs. Lamar
hearing it with an involuntary sigh of relief, for she had
been very uncomfortably conscious that her dinner was
growing cold, and she particularly prided herself on
always having her meats and vegetables served up
hot.</p>

<p>She mentally resolved to enjoin it upon the major never
again to call upon Tommy Dill to ask a blessing when
other guests were present.</p>

<p>But the guests showed no lack of appreciation of the
fare, partaking of it with keen appetites and praising the
viands without stint.</p>

<p>"Such game as this would be considered a rarity in
my country," remarked Lyttleton, as the major heaped his
plate for the second or third time; "but I presume it is
abundant here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
"Plenty of it to be had for the shooting," was the
reply; "our woods are full of wild fowl, deer, bears,
rabbits, squirrels and coons; and the rivers abound in
fish. And such crops of corn as are raised in this Scioto
valley you never saw, I venture to say. I'm glad you've
come out here, Bernard; I shall take delight in showing
you the land."</p>

<p>"Ah, the major is riding his hobby now," laughed
Mrs. Lamar; "he is quite convinced that Ohio, you
know we have just been admitted into the Union, Mr.
Lyttleton, is the finest of all the states."</p>

<p>The Englishman bowed an assent, a half mocking
smile playing about his lips.</p>

<p>Nell saw it and her eyes flashed. She thought he
despised her country.</p>

<p>"How long since you left England?" asked the major,
addressing Lyttleton; and then began an animated discussion
of the political situation in Europe, the attitude
of France and England toward each other, the career of
Bonaparte, then the French revolution, particularly the
Reign of Terror, Mr. Lyttleton greatly interesting the
company by a graphic description of those of its scenes
of which he had been an eye-witness.</p>

<p>He turned frequently to Nell as he spoke, for he read
intense interest in her bated breath, changing color, the
kindling of her eye when he told of some heroic deed,
the tears that suffused it and the tumultuous heaving of
her breast when the anguish of the wretched victims was
his theme.</p>

<p>A connoisseur in female beauty, he was struck with
admiration at the first sight of Nell, the delicacy of her
complexion, the perfect symmetry of form and features,
the queenly grace of every movement, and the abundant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
wealth of beautiful hair that crowned her shapely head.
There was no little display of artistic taste in its arrangement,
and in the simple elegance of her attire.</p>

<p>Lyttleton mentally pronounced Clare also a fine-looking
and intelligent woman. She bore a prominent part in the
conversation, while Nell contented herself almost entirely
with silent listening, though from neither lack of ideas
nor bashfulness, as her speaking countenance and quiet
ease of manner fully attested.</p>

<p>Lyttleton wanted to draw her out, to hear her opinion
on some of the controverted points, so seated himself at
her side, when the dining-room had been forsaken for the
parlor, and asked what she thought of the sentiments
expressed by himself and others.</p>

<p>He found she had an opinion and was able to maintain
it with spirit and ability.</p>

<p>They were still talking earnestly when Kenneth came
in; so earnestly, that they were not aware of his entrance
until the major pronounced his name in introducing
Captain Bernard.</p>

<p>"Dr. Clendenin."</p>

<p>Lyttleton turned hastily at the sound and scanned the
tall, manly figure and noble face with ill concealed eagerness
and curiosity; then as the major named him, "Mr.
Lyttleton, lately from England," rose with a slight bow,
and accepted Kenneth's offered hand with a show of
cordiality and a "Most happy to meet you, sir."</p>

<p>But neither then nor afterward did he give the smallest
hint of his acquaintance with Marian, or his visit to the
neighborhood of Glen Forest. He had read Marian's
nature, delicate, sensitive, reserved, and felt sure that
she would confide to no one the secret of their solitary
rambles, their stolen interviews, much less of the wooing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of his looks and tones, scarcely put into plain words by
his wily tongue.</p>

<p>"I have not committed myself, did not ask her to be
my wife, or even say 'I love you,'" was his inward
thought; "and she would die rather than own that she
had been so lightly won."</p>

<p>Kenneth declined an invitation to be seated.</p>

<p>"I am summoned in haste to a very sick patient," he
said, "and merely stepped in, in passing, to ask Mrs.
Lamar's kind offices for another who is suffering from the
lack of proper nursing."</p>

<p>"Those poor devils of country doctors have a hard life
of it," remarked Lyttleton superciliously, when Kenneth
had gone.</p>

<p>"It is a noble, self-sacrificing life," replied Nell, with
some hauteur, "I know of none that is more so than
Dr. Clendenin's."</p>

<p>She would not have Kenneth pitied or patronized by
this insolent stranger, and she glanced with scorn at the
white hands, delicate and shapely almost as a woman's,
one of which was toying with the seals of a heavy gold
watch chain in a way to display to advantage a brilliant
gem that glittered on the little finger.</p>

<p>They were alone at the moment, the major and his
friend having followed Mrs. Lamar and Kenneth to the
outer door.</p>

<p>Lyttleton lifted his eyebrows meaningly, and with a
slight expressive shrug of the shoulders:</p>

<p>"Ah, I beg pardon, Miss Lamar! an intimate and particular
friend of yours? I was not aware of it; and in
fact was merely speaking of the class in general."</p>

<p>"And I was defending the whole profession," remarked
Nell, "of which Dr. Clendenin, our family physician, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the representative to us. We owe him much for his
kind and faithful services in more than one dangerous
illness among us."</p>

<p>Lyttleton remarked that her sentiments did her honor;
then with a desire to introduce a fresh topic, "You have
an odd character in that Mr. Dill," he said, "or is that
the sort of grace usual at meals in this part of the
world?"</p>

<p>"I never heard such from any one else," Nell answered
with gravity. "He is an excellent man, but slightly deranged.
There was a meeting of one of our church
courts in town yesterday, and he always attends. But
he has gone now to his home and we shall probably see
no more of him for some time."</p>

<p>"I'm going with the major to take a look at the town;
will you go along, Mr. Lyttleton?"</p>

<p>Captain Bernard spoke from the open door.</p>

<p>"Thank you, yes;" and with a courteous "Good-afternoon"
to Nell, Lyttleton followed the others into
the street.</p>

<p>He had come to Chillicothe with the undivulged intention
of taking up his residence there for some months,
and having made the tour of the town he called at the
General Anthony Wayne and engaged board and lodging
for himself and servant; his choice secretly influenced
by the discovery that it was there that Dr. Clendenin took
his meals; for Lyttleton had his own private reasons for
wishing to see and hear all he could of Kenneth and his
manner of life.</p>

<p>Captain Bernard made a like arrangement, though for
a shorter period of time; then having seen their luggage
bestowed in their rooms and refreshed themselves by a
change of linen, they returned to the major's for the rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
of the day and evening, in accordance with his urgent
invitation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamar being still absent on her errand of mercy,
it fell to Nell's lot to do the honors of the tea-table; a
duty of which she acquitted herself with an ease and
grace that increased the admiration Lyttleton had
already conceived for her.</p>

<p>Primitive customs still prevailed in Chillicothe; the
tea hour was so early that when they rose from the table
the sun had scarcely set behind the western hills.
And the hunter's moon shone full-orbed over the tree
tops.</p>

<p>The captain proposed a walk, remarking that the evening
was much too fine to be spent within doors, and he
and the major set off together, strolling along in leisurely
fashion, smoking and talking of "the days of auld
lang syne."</p>

<p>They had invited Nell and Lyttleton to accompany
them, but both had declined; the one pleading the
necessity of attending to some domestic duty devolving
upon her in her sister's absence, the other that he found
himself already sufficiently fatigued with riding and walking.</p>

<p>"Never mind me, major," he said, seating himself in
the porch, and coaxing little three year old Bertie to his
knee; "I'll amuse myself with these little folks till you
return."</p>

<p>He soon had the whole flock about him, telling them
stories and singing them songs, and they were having a
merry time when Aunt Nell came to the door to say that
it was their bed time and Maria was waiting.</p>

<p>Daylight had quite faded out of the sky and the air
grown so chill that the warmth of the blazing wood fire in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the parlor was far from unpleasant to Lyttleton as he followed
the children into the house.</p>

<p>Begging the guest to excuse her for a moment, and to
make himself entirely at home, Nell went away with
Maria and the children.</p>

<p>Lyttleton stood by the fire musing.</p>

<p>"What a handsome girl! and her manners would not
disgrace a court. She's some years older, and more
formed than Clendenin's sister; quite as fine looking too,
though an entirely different style of beauty; not over
twenty I should say. The other I take to be fifteen.
Clendenin admires her vastly; I saw that in his glance,
and that he saw in me a possible rival. Well, I shall
enjoy getting into her good graces none the less for
that."</p>

<p>Two candles were burning on the table, and beside
them a piece of delicate embroidery which Nell took up
on her return to the room.</p>

<p>Lyttleton drew a chair to her side and exerted his conversational
powers to the utmost for her entertainment;
evidently not without success; her low musical laugh rang
out again and again, she gave him many a bright glance
from her liquid eyes, and many a quick word of repartee.</p>

<p>He grew more and more interested in her and congratulated
himself on his good fortune in having come
upon such a gem "here in the wilderness."</p>

<p>Suddenly he started, turned pale, and half rose from
his chair with a low exclamation of fear or dismay. His
eyes seemed fixed upon some object behind Nell, whose
back was toward the hall door, and she turned her head
hastily to see what it was.</p>

<p>A tall Indian, dressed in native costume, tomahawk
and scalping knife in his belt, and feathers in his hair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
stood there regarding the Englishman with a contemptuous
smile.</p>

<p>"Ugh! big baby!" he grunted.</p>

<p>"Wawillaway!" cried Nell, springing up and shaking
hands with the chief in the most cordial manner; "you
are welcome, always welcome to my brother's wigwam!
Mr. Lyttleton, you need not be alarmed; Wawillaway is
my very good friend, and has always been a brother to
the white man."</p>

<p>The major coming in at that moment with Captain
Bernard, echoed his sister's words of welcome, as he
grasped the chief's hand and shook it heartily.</p>

<p>The captain did likewise, gazing with admiration upon
the tall sinewy form and well developed limbs of this
untutored son of the forest.</p>

<p>Leaving the gentlemen to entertain each other, Nell
led the way to the dining-room, and with her own fair
hands set before the chief an abundant supply of the
best food the house afforded.</p>

<p>He ate heartily, then wrapping his blanket about him,
stretched himself upon the kitchen floor with his feet to
the fire.</p>

<p>"Pray do not deem me a coward," Lyttleton said in a
low aside to Nell on her return to the parlor. "It was
my first sight of an Indian, I unarmed, and I expected
to see that tomahawk go crashing through your brain."</p>

<p>"I shall endeavor to make all due allowance," Nell
answered courteously; but he fancied that he read contempt
in the smile that accompanied her words.</p>

<p>It nettled him, and he mentally resolved to seize the
first opportunity of proving to her that he was not lacking
in courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xv" id="chapter_xv">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>"What do you think of this Englishman?"</p>

<p>Dale was pacing Kenneth's office with his hands in his
pockets, while the latter, seated before his table, where
were arranged various bottles, gallipots, and a delicate
pair of scales, was busily engaged in weighing out medicines
and putting them in powders.</p>

<p>He smiled slightly, then answered in a grave, somewhat
preoccupied tone:</p>

<p>"Handsome, intelligent, travelled, apparently wealthy!
can be very interesting in conversation, but haunts my
office a little more than is perfectly agreeable to a man
whose time is often more than money."</p>

<p>"No insinuation I hope?" returned Dale, laughing
and shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Not at all, Godfrey, I feel at liberty to invite you to
retire when I wish to be rid of you."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I regard that as an incontrovertible
proof of friendship. But to return; I don't fancy the
fellow; he's too highly polished; his extreme suavity of
manner fills me with a desire to knock him down.
There's nothing like an air of patronage to make my
angry passions rise."</p>

<p>"And then he's forever at Miss Lamar's side, robbing
every other fellow of the least chance to bask in her
smiles. I haven't been able to exchange a dozen sentences
with her in the week that he's been in our town.
I vote that he be sent back to his own country."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Dale did not see the half spasm of pain that contracted
Kenneth's brow for an instant.</p>

<p>"I must go now, have to ride ten miles into the country,"
he said, folding the last powder; then bestowing
them, along with such other medical and surgical appliances
as he might have need of, in his saddle-bags, he
summoned Zeb to put them on his horse, ready saddled,
at the door, and donning overcoat and hat, hurried out,
mounted and away at a rapid gallop.</p>

<p>The principal streets had now been cleared of trees
and Indians wigwams alike; they were very wide and
straight, giving an extended view and plenty of room for
the passage of equestrians and vehicles.</p>

<p>Far ahead of him Kenneth could see a lady and gentleman
on horseback cantering briskly along; he overtook
them, and in passing caught, and returned, a smile
and bow from Nell Lamar and the Englishman.</p>

<p>They were out for a ride through the gay, beautiful
woods this delicious October morning.</p>

<p>Something akin to envy of Lyttleton stirred for a
moment in Kenneth's breast; but he struggled against
it.</p>

<p>"Why should I grudge to him the prize that can never
be mine?" he asked himself. "And am I so utterly, so
abominably selfish, that I cannot rejoice in her happiness,
though it be with another? Faster, faster, good
Romeo," he continued aloud, patting the neck of his
noble steed; "let us bestir ourselves, my boy, for we are
needed yonder, and jealousy and envy must be left
behind."</p>

<p>The intelligent creature seemed to understand, and
urged by neither whip nor spur, flew over the ground
with almost the speed of the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Far in the distance a farm-house loomed up into sight,
and as they drew rapidly nearer Kenneth could descry a
horseman galloping furiously toward it from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>His first thought was that it might be another messenger
from the house to which he was bound, some
miles farther on, and where a patient lay very ill.</p>

<p>But no; the man drew rein at the gate of the dwelling
already in sight, and as Kenneth came dashing up,
was in earnest colloquy with the farmer.</p>

<p>They hailed him.</p>

<p>"Hollo, doctor! stop a bit. Have you heard the
news?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered, coming to a sudden halt alongside
of the other horseman, whom he now recognized as
a farmer living some distance down the prairie. "Are
you the bearer of evil tidings, Coe, an accident, some
one hurt? I have hardly time to stop unless my services
are needed."</p>

<p>"Worse than that, doctor; he's beyond your help,
poor fellow; but you'd best listen, for all that!"</p>

<p>"Yes," put in the other man, with an oath, "it's the
doin's o' those cussed red skins, an' if ye don't look out
doc, they'll be takin' your scalp afore ye know it."</p>

<p>"What! you don't mean that the Indians have begun
hostilities again, Wolf?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I do!" he cried with a yet fiercer oath, and
bringing his fist down heavily upon the palm of the other
hand; "here's Coe brings news that Captain Herrod's
found lyin' in the woods murdered and scalped; Captain
Herrod, a man greatly loved by his neighbors, as ye must
know, and of course it's their work; and the next thing
they'll be burning down our houses about our ears, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
butcherin' and scalpin' men, women and children, as
they did afore Mad Anthony Wayne whipped 'em into
good behavior. The dirty, sneakin', treacherous rascals!"
he went on, "I hate 'em like pizen."</p>

<p>"Is there any positive proof that Herrod met his
death at their hands?" Kenneth asked, turning to Coe.</p>

<p>"No; but it looks likely; and I'm out to warn the
settlers in the valley that we'd best be moving close
together and building block-houses for protection."</p>

<p>"That we had," exclaimed Wolf, again cursing the
savages as cruel and treacherous.</p>

<p>"They have often proved so in past times," said
Kenneth; "yet there have been some noble exceptions,
and certainly we have not been guiltless in our treatment
of them."</p>

<p>"We've paid 'em back in their own coin," Wolf answered
with a savage grin; "and we'll do it again; I'd
as lief shoot a red skin as a dog any day."</p>

<p>"Yet it is as truly murder as to kill a white man,"
said Kenneth, "for God hath made of one blood all
nations of men. But we have no time to talk, Coe. You
go on to Chillicothe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and beyond, warning everybody to be getting
ready for the worst. I must be off. Good day to ye
both, gentlemen."</p>

<p>He put spurs to his horse, but Kenneth called after
him:</p>

<p>"Stay a moment; I passed a lady and gentleman
riding out from the town. Be on the lookout for them
and warn them to hurry back, will you?"</p>

<p>"All right, doc!" and each sped on his way,
Kenneth's thoughts divided between grief for the violent
death of a friend and neighbor, and anxiety for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
patient, and for sweet Nell Lamar, who might be even
now in danger from the savages.</p>

<p>Alas, to have to trust her to the Englishman's care,
and he in all probability entirely unarmed!</p>

<p>It was sorely against his will that Kenneth continued
to increase the distance between her and himself.</p>

<p>Nor did he tarry unnecessarily in the sick room or
snatch even a moment to refresh himself with food,
though in need of it and urgently pressed to sit down
to a well spread board.</p>

<p>"Do now, doctor, stop and take a bite," entreated
the lady of the house, following him to the door; "why
it'll be the middle of the afternoon or even later before
you can get back to Chillicothe."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Mrs. Bray," he said, tightening
his saddle girth as he spoke, "but I really do not feel
hungry, and am in very great haste to return."</p>

<p>"Excited over this news of poor Captain Herrod?"
she said. "Well, it's just as likely to have been the work
of some white man as of the Indians, I think; somebody
that's had a grudge against him."</p>

<p>"He was much beloved, Mrs. Bray."</p>

<p>"That's true too, and yet I've heard he had an
enemy."</p>

<p>"I do not know, but hope it may not prove the beginning
of hostilities," Kenneth returned as he sprang into
the saddle. "Good afternoon, madame. Now, Romeo,
good fellow, on at the top of your speed."</p>

<p>He glanced warily from side to side, alert but courageous,
as he skimmed over the prairies and plunged
through the forests; yet no sign of lurking savage
rewarded his vigilance.</p>

<p>He did not halt or slacken his pace till fairly within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the limits of the town; then allowing his panting steed
to fall into a walk, he looked up and down the streets.</p>

<p>People were hurrying along in unusual haste, or standing
in groups talking earnestly, with grave, sad, anxious
faces.</p>

<p>Major Lamar, detaching himself from one of these
knots of talkers, called to Kenneth to stop, then coming
to his side asked if he had heard the news.</p>

<p>"Of poor Captain Herrod? Yes. What is thought
of it, that it's the doing of the Indians?"</p>

<p>"There are various opinions. We have held a town
meeting, resolved to prepare for the worst, discovered
that there is no ammunition in town, and started a party
down the river in a pirogue, to bring a supply from
Cincinnati."</p>

<p>"No ammunition in town, is it possible, and we may
be attacked at any moment!"</p>

<p>"True: but we do not hear of any Indians being seen
on the war path. We will hope for the best."</p>

<p>"Miss Nell?" inquired Kenneth, "I passed her and
Lyttleton as I left town this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes; they met Coe and came back in something of
a panic. Nell hardly the more alarmed of the two, I
fancy;" and there was a sly twinkle in the major's eye,
an almost imperceptible smile lurking about the corners
of his mouth.</p>

<p>"She is safe then? I was a little uneasy, not knowing
how far they meant to go."</p>

<p>By this time quite a little crowd had collected about
Romeo, and Kenneth was plied with eager queries as to
the road he had been travelling, and whether he had
seen any signs of hostile Indians.</p>

<p>His replies negativing the last question, seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
afford some slight satisfaction, some hope that there was
less occasion for alarm than had been feared.</p>

<p>Still all were in favor of proceeding with the work,
already resolved upon in the public meeting, of fortifying
the town. Kenneth was dismounting at his office door
when Barbour hailed him, with a request that he would
come at once to his house, as his wife seemed in a very
bad way.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the doctor, hurrying
along by Barbour's side.</p>

<p>"I hardly know, doc; she's a good deal alarmed with
this story of Captain Herrod's murder, and really seems
hardly able to breathe."</p>

<p>"Hysteria, doubtless."</p>

<p>"Dangerous?"</p>

<p>"No, not particularly so," returned the doctor dryly.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Barbour managed to detain him in attendance
upon her for a couple of hours, insisting that she
should certainly die if he left her, till at last he was compelled
to tell her that he could not stay another moment,
nor was it at all necessary that he should.</p>

<p>Returning to his office he found Major Lamar waiting
for him, with an invitation to tea. Kenneth demurred,
though beginning to be most uncomfortably sensible that
he had not tasted food since an early breakfast, but the
major would take no denial.</p>

<p>"I have some very fine game, and have set my heart
upon sharing the enjoyment of it with you," he said;
"and I shall be quite in disgrace with my wife if I fail to
bring you according to promise. Bernard and Lyttleton
are to sup with us too; so that you may feel assured of a
feast of reason and a flow of soul," he added, jocosely;
"the Englishman is a good talker, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
"Yes, his conversational powers are enviable," Kenneth
answered in a tone of hearty good will. "And
since you are so kindly urgent, major, I will go with you."</p>

<p>A vision of Lyttleton basking in Nell's sunny smiles,
calling forth her silvery laughter with his mirth-provoking
sallies, thrilling her with his stories of wild adventure,
or moving her to tears with the pathos of his description
of human suffering or heroism in times of danger, had
brought about this decision, erroneously ascribed by the
major to the attractiveness of the picture he had drawn.</p>

<p>Kenneth made a hasty toilet and they walked over to
the major's together.</p>

<p>Full half of Lyttleton's time during this week in Chillicothe
had been spent there, as Kenneth knew to his no
small disturbance. In vain he reminded himself that he
could never claim Nell as his own, therefore had not the
shadow of a right to stand in the way of another; he
could not school his heart into a willingness to utterly
resign the faint hope that would linger there, spite of
reason's mighty arguments against it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xvi" id="chapter_xvi">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Lyttleton and Nell were in the gayest spirits that
morning as they sped briskly onward through forest and
over prairie, talking cheerily of the sweetness of the air,
the beauty of the woods, and exchanging many a little
harmless jest, no thought of danger troubling them.</p>

<p>They were several miles out from the town when they
espied a small cloud of dust far ahead which seemed to
be rapidly drawing nearer.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Nell, reining in her pony, while
she sent an anxious gaze in the direction of the approaching
cloud. "Ah, I see, it is a man riding as if for life."</p>

<p>"After a doctor, I suspect," observed Lyttleton;
"some one hurt, perhaps."</p>

<p>"But he must have passed Dr. Clendenin," returned
Nell, "so it can hardly be that." And as the man at that
moment came dashing up she turned her pony aside to
let him pass.</p>

<p>Instead he halted close beside them with a suddenness
that nearly threw his horse upon his haunches.</p>

<p>"Go back," he panted; "turn right around and go
back to the town as fast as you can make your beasts
move; don't spare whip nor spur, for there's no tellin'
but the woods may be full of Injuns this minute. They've
found Captain Herrod lyin' dead and scalped in the
woods, and I'm out to rouse the neighborhood; for of
course it's altogether likely to have been the doin's o' the
redskins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
"Captain Herrod!" exclaimed Nell, tears starting to
her eyes; "can it be? It is not more than a week since he
dined at my brother's table, and we all liked him so much."</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, he was a fine man, liked by a'most everybody,"
said Coe. "But we'd best be moving on. We'll
put the lady in between us, sir, for her better protection.
And now for Chillicothe!"</p>

<p>As the three came galloping furiously into the town,
people rushed to their doors and windows, and Coe,
checking his horse, and calling aloud that he was the
bearer of important tidings, an eager, questioning crowd
quickly gathered about him, and the news spread like
wildfire through the place.</p>

<p>Lyttleton dashed up to the major's door, and only
waiting to assist Nell to alight, he remounted and hurried
back to the spot where they had left Coe; then giving
his horse into his servant's care, he followed the crowd
and was present at the town meeting.</p>

<p>"What a precious pack of fools, to be caught so!" he
muttered on hearing the announcement that there was no
ammunition in the place. "I say, captain," to his friend
Bernard, who stood by his side, "I wish we were well out
of this, I've no mind to stay here and be butchered by
the wild Indians."</p>

<p>"Better go at once, then," sneered the captain.</p>

<p>"Go? through the woods where they are probably
swarming? Thank you, no; 'twould be a greater risk
than to stay where I am."</p>

<p>"Suppose then you go with the party in the pirogue,
down the river to Cincinnati?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! that would be scarcely safer; the savages
might easily pursue it in a canoe, or fire on us from the
shore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
"Then my advice to you is to stay and meet the danger
like a man."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," stammered Lyttleton; "but
I wish I'd never come. I shouldn't, if I hadn't understood
that all danger of hostilities was entirely past. I've
no mind to go home to old England without my scalp."</p>

<p>"If that's your only concern," returned the captain
dryly, "you may set your mind at rest; there's no danger
that you will go back without your scalp."</p>

<p>"You mean that they'll finish me if they get the chance,"
muttered Lyttleton, turning away with a look of intense
disgust.</p>

<p>"He's a coward!" said the captain to himself; and
Nell Lamar was at that very moment expressing the same
opinion to Clare at the conclusion of a breathless narration
of the events of the last hour.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, don't be too ready to judge him
hardly," returned Clara, who was partial to the Englishman's
handsome person, winning address, and apparently
full purse, and would have been more than willing to
bestow Nell's hand upon him.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to be unjust or uncharitable," said
Nell, "but he was so pale and so agitated from the
moment he heard the news till he left me here at the
door that I was even forced to the conclusion that he
was afraid."</p>

<p>The afternoon was full of excitement. Dale ran in for
a moment to say good-by. He was one of the party
detailed to go for ammunition.</p>

<p>"You will be in danger?" Nell said inquiringly, as
they shook hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, probably: yet perhaps not more so than those
who stay behind. I'm not specially uneasy on that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
score, in fact, have but one objection to going upon the
errand, that in case of an attack during our absence I
shall not be here to help defend you."</p>

<p>He seemed excited but full of a cheerful courage.
"Don't be too anxious, ladies, I cannot help hoping the
whole thing will blow over," were his last words as he
hurried away.</p>

<p>An unspoken fear lay heavy at Nell's heart, Dr. Clendenin,
where was he? Coe had told of his warning to
him, but that he had gone on his way all the same as if
no danger lay in it, and Nell reflected with a feeling of
exultant admiration, that he would never desert the
post of duty through fear of consequences to himself.</p>

<p>But should she ever see him again? He might be
even now lying dead and scalped by the roadside or in
the woods, as Captain Herrod had been found, or perchance
wounded and bleeding, dying for lack of help.</p>

<p>How she shuddered and turned pale at the very thought,
while now and again a wild impulse seized her to mount
her pony and away in search of him.</p>

<p>At length the suspense and anxiety were unendurable,
and hastily tying on her garden hat, she hurried out into
the street.</p>

<p>She had gone scarcely a square when at no great distance
she descried, glad sight, Romeo and his master
surrounded by a little crowd of eager, excited men, and
with a sigh of intense relief she turned a corner and
walked briskly on, her heart full of joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p>But Kenneth could never have guessed her feelings
from her quiet, almost indifferent greeting that evening,
and indeed was sorely pained by the contrast of her
manner to him and to Lyttleton, whom in her heart she
despised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
The latter hovered about her all the evening, admiring
the delicate embroidery growing beneath her white, taper
fingers, paying her graceful compliments and indulging
in witticisms that now and then provoked a saucy reply
or a ripple of silvery laughter.</p>

<p>Apparently they were full of careless mirth, while the
others, sitting together about the fire, discussed with grave
and anxious faces the present threatening posture of
affairs. Kenneth bore his share in the conversation,
being frequently appealed to by the major, as one whose
opinion was worthy of all consideration, yet furtively
watched Nell and her vis-a-vis; the seeming favor in
which Lyttleton was held pained him, yet Nell was not
consciously coquetting.</p>

<p>Both the major and the captain had seen something of
Indian warfare, and the transition was natural and easy
from the threatened danger of the present to the perils
and exploits of the past, each having something to tell
of the daring and bravery of the other.</p>

<p>At first the stories were of encounters with the red men
of the woods, then revolutionary scenes were recalled.</p>

<p>"Major," exclaimed the captain, "do you remember
your big Hessian?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly: that is, his general appearance; he
was not near enough for his features to be very strongly
impressed upon my memory."</p>

<p>"And he has never appeared to you?" queried the
captain with a laugh.</p>

<p>"No," returned the major, gazing meditatively into
the fire; "what right would he have to haunt me, captain,
seeing he was killed in battle?"</p>

<p>"None, of course; and he shows his sense of justice
in refraining."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
"What were the circumstances?" inquired Kenneth,
with interest which seemed to be shared by all
present.</p>

<p>"It was on one occasion when our forces and those of
the British were drawn up in line of battle in full view of
each other," said the captain, "that a big Hessian officer
stepped out in front of his men and with a good deal of
angry, excited gesticulation and loud vociferation in his
barbarous tongue, seemed to be defying the American
army much as Goliath defied the armies of Israel.</p>

<p>"The impudence and effrontery of the thing roused
my ire; I turned with an indignant remark to the major
here, he was only captain then, by the way, but before
the words had left my lips he had taken a gun from a
soldier and shot the fellow down where he stood."</p>

<p>"Some of those Hessians were very brutal," remarked
Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain, "war was their trade, and
what better could one expect from men who fought, not
for country or for principle, but simply for hire; the
more shame to the government that employed them
against freemen battling for their liberties!"</p>

<p>"Yet preferable, I should say, to the wily and treacherous
savages the Americans have been accustomed to
fighting." Lyttleton's tone was flippant. "I'd sooner
encounter an infuriated Hessian, Frenchman, any kind
of white man, or even ghost, than a whooping, yelling
painted savage on the war path, as they call it."</p>

<p>"That's an acknowledgment," remarked the captain
dryly; "especially in view of the fact that they, too,
were employed against us by the mother country, as
Americans once delighted to call her."</p>

<p>"However, that is all past, and certainly we owe no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
grudge to you, Lyttleton," he added turning toward the
latter with a genial smile.</p>

<p>"All Indians are not cruel and treacherous," observed
Nell, her fair cheek flushing and her violet eyes kindling;
"Tecumseh is a noble exception; Wawillaway
also; I would trust my life in his hands without the
slightest hesitation."</p>

<p>"Yes, Wawillaway is a good Indian," assented her
brother; "has always been friendly to the whites. Nor
shall I ever forget his good service to you, Nell."</p>

<p>The major referred to the adventure with the panther,
which he had related to his guests on a former occasion;
of the more recent and greater service rendered her by
her Indian friend, he knew nothing.</p>

<p>But Nell was thinking of it, recalling with a slight
shudder Wolf's lecherous stare; her eyes were on her
needle-work.</p>

<p>Kenneth could not see their expression, but he wondered
at the trembling of her slender fingers as she
drew the needle in and out, and the varying color on her
cheek.</p>

<p>A moment of silence following the major's last remark,
was suddenly broken by a thundering rap upon the
outer door.</p>

<p>All started to their feet, with the common thought
that the threatened danger had come, and Kenneth turned
with a quick, protecting gesture toward Nell, while
Lyttleton glanced hurriedly around, as if in search of
some hiding place.</p>

<p>Neither movement was lost upon the young girl; she
saw and appreciated both; more afterward than at the
moment.</p>

<p>But their alarm was groundless. Tig had gone to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
door and a voice was heard asking for Dr. Clendenin.
"What is it, Gotlieb?" he asked, stepping out to the
hall, and recognizing in the messenger a German lad
whose parents lived next door to the Barbours.</p>

<p>"Mine mudder she send me for you, doctor, to goame
right quick to Meeses Barbour; she pees ferry seeck."</p>

<p>Kenneth had his doubts about the correctness of the
report, yet nevertheless, bidding a hasty good-night to
his friends, hurried away with the messenger.</p>

<p>He found the patient again in violent hysterics, which
Gotlieb's mother was vainly trying to relieve.</p>

<p>"O doctor," she cried, "it is goot you haf come. I
know not what to do for dis womans. She schream and
she laf and she gry, and I can't do notings mit her."</p>

<p>"What caused this attack, Mrs. Hedwig?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Vell, doctor, I prings mine work to sit mit her, and I
zay 'I must make dese flannel tings for mine childer
pefore de Injuns comes; pecause it pees very cold in de
woods for mine Lena, and mine Gotlieb, and mine Karl,
when dose Injuns take 'em.' And just so soon I say dat,
she pegins to schream and to laf and to gry lige&mdash;lige von
grazy womans."</p>

<p>She seemed much disturbed, and alarmed, inquiring
anxiously, "Do you dinks she fery bad sick, doctor? vil
she die?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," he said, "she'll be over it directly."</p>

<p>"She might have known better than to talk about the
Indians coming. It frightens me to death," sobbed the
invalid; "and Tom was shamefully thoughtless to send
such a person in to sit with me. He ought to have stayed
himself; there are plenty of other men to work at fortifying
the town. But nobody ever thinks of poor me."</p>

<p>"It would be far better for you if you could forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
yourself, Mrs. Barbour," said Kenneth. "Drink this, if
you please, and then go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Go to sleep, indeed, and she sitting there working
on those flannel garments, just as if the Indians would let
her children live to wear them, if they come."</p>

<p>It was late when Kenneth returned to his office, and he
was weary in mind and body; yet hours passed before
he retired to rest. His thoughts were full of Nell, going
over and over each scene in his life in which she had
borne a part, recalling every look she had given him in
which he had read the sweet secret of her love, his features
now lighted up with joy, now distorted with pain,
cold drops of agony standing on his brow.</p>

<p>"What a heartless wretch must I appear to her!" he
groaned, pacing his office with folded arms and head
bowed upon his breast. "Oh my darling! I would die
to save you a single pang, and yet I dare not tell you
that I love you. I must stand by in silence and see
another win you. Perhaps even now your love is turned
to hate, and if it be so I cannot blame you."</p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xvii" id="chapter_xvii">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>It was long past noon: the sun shone, but as through a
veil, a soft October haze mellowing the brightness of
the beautiful woods where a solitary figure, that of a tall
Indian, was following the trail with long, rapid strides.</p>

<p>It was the Shawnee chief Wawillaway; not on the
war path, for though armed as usual with gun, tomahawk
and scalping knife, no war club was in his hand, no paint
on his face.</p>

<p>He had been on a peaceful errand to Old Town, to
dispose of his baskets, game and peltries, and was now
quietly wending his homeward way.</p>

<p>No report of Herrod's death, and the consequent excitement
and alarm among the settlers in the Scioto
valley, had reached Wawillaway, and when he saw three
white men, Wolf and two men whom he had hired to
assist him on his farm, coming toward him, no thought
of hostile intention on their part or his own was in his
heart.</p>

<p>They met him in the trail and he shook hands cordially
with them, inquiring about their health and that of
their families.</p>

<p>A little talk followed and Wolf proposed to the chief
to exchange guns, took Wawillaway's on a pretence of
examining it with a view to purchase, slyly blew out the
priming, and handing it back, said he did not care to
swap.</p>

<p>Wawillaway had seen his treacherous act, but still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
unsuspicious, took his own gun handing back the
other.</p>

<p>"Have the Indians begun war?" asked one of
Wolf's companions.</p>

<p>"No, no," said the chief, "the Indians and white
men are all one; all brothers now."</p>

<p>"Why, haven't you heard that the Indians have killed
Captain Herrod?" asked Wolf.</p>

<p>Wawillaway looked astonished, and incredulous.</p>

<p>"No, no! Indian not kill Captain Herrod," he said.
"Captain Herrod not dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is; it's certain that he was found dead and
scalped in the woods a few days ago," said Wolf.</p>

<p>"Maybe fire water; too much drink make fight."</p>

<p>"No, Herrod hadn't any quarrel with the Indians; and
we don't know which of them killed him."</p>

<p>"Maybe some bad white man killed Captain Herrod,"
suggested Wawillaway; then shaking hands all round
again, he turned to go on his way, when the dastardly
Wolf shot him in the back, mortally wounding him.</p>

<p>The brave chieftain, wounded as he was, and deprived
of the use of his gun, turned upon his cowardly assailants
with his tomahawk, and spite of the superiority of
numbers, killed one, and severely wounded Wolf and the
others.</p>

<p>A distant sound of horses' hoofs sent them flying into
the woods, leaving the lifeless body of their comrade, and
the bleeding, dying chief lying in the trail.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sounds, and in another
moment two farmers returning from Chillicothe to their
homes, had come to a sudden halt beside the prostrate
forms and were gazing with grief, horror and dismay
upon the bloody scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
"It's Wawillaway!" cried one, hastily dismounting
and stooping over the chief. "Who can have done
this cruel, wicked deed, for he has always been the
white man's friend! Ah, he's not dead, thank God!
Come, Miller, help me to raise him up."</p>

<p>They did so as gently as possible, but life was ebbing
fast; they saw it in his glazing eye and the clammy sweat
upon his brow.</p>

<p>Another horseman came galloping up and drew rein
close at hand, then leaping to the ground came hurriedly
toward the little group.</p>

<p>"Dr. Clendenin," cried Miller, "you have come in
the nick of time!"</p>

<p>"No," sighed Kenneth, taking the cold hand of the
chief, "he is beyond human help. Wawillaway, my
poor friend, whose fiendish work is this?"</p>

<p>With a great effort the chief rallied his expiring energies
sufficiently to tell in a few broken sentences, of Wolf's
perfidious and cruel deed, then gasped and died.</p>

<p>"He is gone," Kenneth said in a voice tremulous and
husky with emotion, "and this foul deed of a blood-thirsty,
conscienceless wretch, will in all probability be
visited upon our infant settlements in a tempest of fire
and blood."</p>

<p>"Wolf! the scoundrel is rightly named," muttered
Miller between his clenched teeth. "Andrews," to his
comrade, "we should be scouring the woods in search of
him at this moment. If we could catch and deliver him
up to justice, it might go far toward averting the threatened
storm."</p>

<p>"Yes, and there's no time to be lost; but the first
thing is to hurry home and secure the safety of our
families."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
"The alarm should be given at once in Chillicothe,"
said Kenneth, hastily mounting as he spoke; "that shall
be my task, and doubtless a party will be sent out at
once in search of this cowardly villain, Wolf."</p>

<p>In another moment all three had left the scene of blood
and death, and were galloping furiously through the
woods; the farmers toward their homes, Kenneth in the
direction of the town.</p>

<p>The sun had set some time before, it was already
growing dark, and when he reached Chillicothe many of
the people had retired for the night.</p>

<p>Coming in at the end of the town farthest from Major
Lamar's house, and stopping to call up and consult
with several of the other influential citizens, whose dwellings
lay between, he was late in reaching it.</p>

<p>Nell was roused from her first nap by a loud knocking
on the outer door, and a familiar voice calling,
"Major!"</p>

<p>She sprang to the window and opened it.</p>

<p>"What is it, doctor?" she asked, her voice trembling
a little with excitement and alarm in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to disturb you," he answered, something
in his low, earnest tones sending a strange thrill
through her whole being, "but there is not an instant to
be lost. Dear Miss Nell, rouse the household and dress
yourself with all haste, not forgetting a shawl and bonnet,
for the night air is chill in&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened at that moment and the major's voice
was heard.</p>

<p>"What's wrong? Ah, is it you, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, major, Wawillaway lies dead out yonder on the
trail to Old Town, slain treacherously in cold blood,
by that scoundrel Wolf, and of course we may expect an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
attack from the Indians as soon as they can get here
after the news reaches them. It has been decided that
the women and children shall be collected in Ferguson's
house; that being the largest in town. Can I be of any
assistance in getting yours there?"</p>

<p>"No, no, thank you. I'll have them there directly,
and you will be wanting to warn others."</p>

<p>The doctor rode rapidly away, while the major shut
the door and called to his wife and children.</p>

<p>"Up! dress yourself as fast as you can! Nell!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "I'll be there in a moment."</p>

<p>She had heard all and was hurrying on her clothes
with trembling fingers, the tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"O Wawillaway, Wawillaway, you have died for me!"
she sobbed. "O that cruel, cruel wretch! worse than
the wild beast that shares his name!"</p>

<p>Sounds of commotion came from below, the little ones
crying, Clare calling in frightened tones, "Nell, Nell, do
come help with the children, if you can! I shall never
get them dressed." The servants added their terrified
clamor, as they rushed hither and thither in obedience to
the orders of master or mistress, collecting such articles
of value or necessity as could be thought of and found in
the hurry and alarm of the moment.</p>

<p>The major alone preserved his calmness and presence
of mind, and thus was able to control and direct the
others.</p>

<p>At Clare's call Nell dashed away her tears, snatched
up hat and shawl and ran down-stairs.</p>

<p>"Dressed!" said Clare. "You've been very quick.
Now help with the children. They're too frightened or
too sleepy to get into their clothes, and Maria's so
scared she's of no use whatever."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
"Calm yourselves, wife and sister," said the major,
coming from an adjoining room. "We must put our
trust in God, who we know will not suffer any real evil to
befall His people; and the Indians can hardly reach the
town under an hour or two at the very earliest."</p>

<p>His words and the quiet composure with which they
were uttered had a soothing effect upon the ladies,
calming their agitation and reviving their courage.</p>

<p>In a very short time the whole family were in the street
rapidly winding their way to Mr. Ferguson's, toward
which terrified women and children were now hurrying
from every quarter.</p>

<p>The town was thoroughly awake; lights gleamed in all
the houses, and every possible preparation was being
made to receive and repel the expected attack. Sentinels
were posted, and an old man who had served as drummer
in the Revolutionary war was appointed to give the signal,
the roll of the drum, should the enemy be seen
approaching.</p>

<p>As the major and his family neared the place of rendezvous,
they fell in with Captain Bernard and Lyttleton,
who followed them into the house inquiring if there were
anything they could do to make the ladies more comfortable.</p>

<p>As the light of a candle burning in the hall fell on
Nell's face, Lyttleton saw the traces of tears on her
cheeks and bright drops still shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do not be too greatly alarmed; doubtless we shall
succeed in keeping the savages at bay," he whispered
protectingly. "I have a brace of pistols here, and you
may rest assured will make your safety my special
charge."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she said, drawing herself up slightly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
while the color deepened on her cheek&mdash;"no, I believe I
am; but it is not that that causes my tears;" and they
burst forth afresh as she spoke.</p>

<p>"What then?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"I weep for my friend, my poor murdered friend,
lying stiff and stark yonder in the woods," and the tears
fell like rain.</p>

<p>"What, the Indian!" he exclaimed in utter amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, for Wawillaway. Did he not save my life?
Yes, twice he has rescued me from a wild beast, first a
panther, then a Wolf," she said with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Aunt Nell, Aunt Nell, I so sleepy, I so tired," sobbed
little Bertie, her three year old nephew and especial pet;
"please sit down and take me in your lap."</p>

<p>She had the child by the hand; the crowd was pushing
them on; was between them and the rest of the family,
and now separated her from Lyttleton.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are! come this way," the major said,
appearing in an open doorway at the end of the hall;
and snatching up Bertie, he hurried back into the large
living room, Nell following.</p>

<p>Tig had brought a great armful of buffalo robes, deer
and bearskins, of which he was making a very comfortable
couch in one corner, under the direction of his mistress.</p>

<p>Clare soon had the children laid upon it, and snugly
covered up with shawls. She then sat down beside them
with her babe in her arms.</p>

<p>"Can't you lie down too, Nell?" she said. "There's
room enough, and you'd better sleep while you can."</p>

<p>"That is not now," Nell answered with a sigh, "but I
will sit down here beside Bertie."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the farther side from Clare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
where her face was in shadow, and little Bertie laid his
head in her lap.</p>

<p>She bent over him, softly stroking his hair and dropping
silent tears upon it. She could not forget Wawillaway.</p>

<p>The room; the house; was full of terrified women and
children&mdash;many of the latter crying violently from discomfort
and fright, while the tearful, trembling mothers
vainly strove to soothe and comfort them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barbour, occupying a distant part of the same
room with the Lamars, paid small attention to hers;
being too much taken up with her own feelings, too busy
bewailing her hard fate, somehow much more to be commiserated
than that of any other person present, and
now and then going off into a violent fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash was there, quiet, patient, cheerful, doing the
best to allay her sister-in-law's excitement and alarm, and
that of her own and her brother's children; nor were her
kind ministrations entirely confined to them; she contrived
to speak words of hope and cheer to others also.</p>

<p>The room was dimly lighted by a candle burning on a
table which had been pushed into a corner to be out of
the way of the numerous beds spread upon the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hedwig placed her two younger children under
this table, bidding them "Go to shleep and nefer fear
dose Inguns; your mutter vil pe right here and take care
off you;" then getting possession of a chair, she sat
down close beside them, drew the candle near her,
snuffed it carefully, opened a bundle she had brought
with her, and began sewing most industriously.</p>

<p>"How can you, Mrs. Hedwig?" cried Mrs. Barbour:
"you're the most cold-blooded creature I ever saw!"</p>

<p>"Dish ish flannel to keeps mine childer warm; mine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
childer must haf dese flannel tings to wear in de woods
mit de Inguns," explained the German woman, dashing
away a tear. "But I hopes dose Inguns nefer gets here
to shteal mine leetle dears."</p>

<p>"If they do come, they'll kill a good many more than
they steal," sobbed another woman. "Oh, dear, oh, dear!
if our men only had plenty of ammunition it wouldn't
seem half so bad!"</p>

<p>"Do stop such doleful talk, all of you," said Mrs.
Nash. "You'll frighten the poor children to death."</p>

<p>"Where are the men? what's become of my Tom?"
fretted Mrs. Barbour.</p>

<p>"The men are doing their duty," answered Mrs. Nash;
"some are guarding this house, some posted as sentinels
on the outskirts of the town, others collecting bows and
arrows, clubs, knives, tomahawks, anything they can fight
with, or putting their valuables in some place of safety."</p>

<p>"And they have sent out a party in search of Wolf,"
added Mrs. Lamar. "I heard the major and Captain
Bernard speaking of it; and if they can catch the wretch
they will hang him, or give him up to the Indians and
let them wreak their vengeance on him, as in justice they
should, instead of on the innocent."</p>

<p>"Let us trust in the Lord and try to sleep," said a
pious old lady who had laid herself calmly down beside
her grandchildren. "We need rest to strengthen us for
the morrow's duties and trials; most of us profess to be
Christians, and why should we not be able to feel that
we are safe in our Father's hands?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"'Not walls nor hills could guard so well</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
A silence fell upon the room as the sweet old voice
ceased, even Mrs. Barbour being shamed into momentary
quiet.</p>

<p>Clare laid her babe down, stretched herself beside it
and the older children, and her regular breathing soon
told that she slept.</p>

<p>But Nell still sat with Bertie's head in her lap, her
face hidden in her hands, while tears trickled between
the white slender fingers, for her thoughts had gone
back to her murdered friend.</p>

<p>"I shall never see him again in this world," she was
saying to herself, "and oh, shall I meet him in another?
Why, why did I never speak to him of Jesus? Now it is
too late, too late!"</p>

<p>Some one sat down beside her and a voice said in low,
rich tones, "I will not be afraid of ten thousands of
people, that have set themselves against me round
about! Dear Miss Nell, some trust in chariots and some
in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord
our God."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, uncovering her face and
hastily wiping away her tears, "but oh, it is not that,
not fear of the Indians," she sobbed, the tears bursting
forth afresh. "Dr. Clendenin, you have not forgotten
what I owe to Wawillaway, and you know but the half!"</p>

<p>"I know that he saved you from the panther," he said
with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes; and from I know not what at the hands of this
very ruffian, Wolf." And in a brief sentence or two she
told of her danger and her escape, adding with a low
cry of pain, "And oh, I fear that it was in revenge for this
that poor Wawillaway was slain. He has died for me!"</p>

<p>Kenneth was much moved, indignation against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Wolf, gratitude for the fair girl's rescue, admiration of
the brave chieftain, grief for his sad end, contending for
the mastery in his breast.</p>

<p>"The wretch!" he said, "he is not worthy to live!
He has killed a better man than himself. I too, grieve
for Wawillaway. But, Miss Nell, you are looking sorely
in need of rest; as your physician I prescribe a few
hours of sleep."</p>

<p>He gently lifted the curly head from her lap to the
couch, and bade her lie down beside the child.</p>

<p>"The major is with the party who are in pursuit of
the assassin, and has left you and the rest of the family
in my care; so that his authority is vested in me for
to-night, in addition to that which I may lawfully claim
as medical adviser," he said with one of his rare sweet
smiles, "so do not venture to disobey my order, fair
lady, and," he added in a still lower whisper, "let me
give you this for a pillow to rest your weary head upon:
'I will both lay me down in peace and sleep: for thou,
Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.'"</p>

</div>

<p>Overcome with grief and weariness Nell unconsciously
obeyed orders ere many minutes had passed, and as the
hours dragged on bringing no new cause of alarm, very
many followed her example, even Mrs. Barbour at length
succumbing to the spell of tired Nature's sweet restorer.</p>

<p>They had a rude awaking. With the first streak of
dawn in the east, the sudden, loud roll of the drum
burst upon the startled air;&mdash;the appointed signal of the
near approach of their savage foe.</p>

<p>Women and children sprang up with wild shrieks and
cries of terror and despair. Kenneth, who had been
pacing the hall, a self-appointed sentry, stepped hastily
in at the door of the room where the Lamars were, his
eyes turning anxiously toward their corner of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamar sat on the side of the couch, trembling
with agitation, clasping her babe close to her breast
and trying to soothe the older ones, who were clinging
about her, with the exception of Bertie whom
Nell, deathly pale, but calm and quiet, was sheltering
in her arms.</p>

<p>Watching her with tell-tale eyes, Kenneth essayed to
speak; but could not make his voice heard amid the
weeping and wailing.</p>

<p>"O doctor, save me, save me!" shrieked Mrs. Barbour,
rushing toward him with outstretched arms and
streaming eyes. "I'll be the first they'll attack; I know
I will, and Tom isn't here to take care of me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
"Yes, he is," shouted Mr. Barbour hurrying in, "yes,
he is, Nancy; though there's no great occasion, for it's
a false alarm, all a mistake. The Indians are as much
scared as we are, and are running the other way."</p>

<p>The excitement toned down rapidly while he spoke,
and now the room was nearly quiet, all who were old
enough to understand being eager to catch every word.</p>

<p>"God be praised," ejaculated Kenneth fervently.
"But the signal, why was it given?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Barbour, smiling, "our old friend had
gone back, in feeling at least, to old revolutionary
times and could not refrain from sounding the reveille."</p>

<p>"'Twas just good sport for him, no doubt, to frighten a
parcel of poor women and children nearly out of their
wits!" was Mrs. Barbour's indignant comment.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said her husband; "he thought every
body would understand it."</p>

<p>Mothers caressed their little ones with murmured
words of joy and thankfulness, feeling as if they had
been suddenly rescued from impending horrible death,
or captivity hardly less to be feared; neighbors and
friends shook hands or embraced with mingled smiles
and tears, congratulating each other that they were, after
all, in no immediate danger.</p>

<p>The party sent in search of Wolf returned without
him; he had made good his escape from that part of
the country.</p>

<p>There was a large body of Indians at that time near
Greenville, and to them Chillicothe presently sent a
deputation of her prominent citizens.</p>

<p>The Indians, among whom was the celebrated chief,
Tecumseh, gathered in their council house, received the
white men and listened to their account of the late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
unfortunate occurrence, their detestation of Wolf's bloody
deed, their ineffectual efforts to catch him, and determination
to put him to death if ever they could secure his
person.</p>

<p>The Indians replied that they knew nothing of these
matters and desired to remain at peace with the whites,
and finally Tecumseh and some others of the chiefs were
persuaded to return with the deputation, and repeat these
assurances to the people of Chillicothe and its vicinity.</p>

<p>A day was appointed, and the people gathered, an
immense throng, to look upon and listen to the great
Shawnee chief.</p>

<p>Major Lamar, his wife and sister were there; the older
children too, for the major said it would be something
for them to remember all their lives.</p>

<p>Captain Bernard and Lyttleton contrived to be near
the Lamars, the latter close at Nell's side, leaning over
her now and then, with an air of devotion and proprietorship
exceedingly distasteful to Kenneth, who furtively
watched them from afar.</p>

<p>But when Tecumseh's tall, commanding figure stood
before them, and he began to speak, every eye turned
toward him, every ear was intent to listen to his voice
and that of his interpreter, a white man who had been a
prisoner among the Indians.</p>

<p>Even as translated the speech was full of eloquent
passages. He spoke in the strongest terms of the
friendly relations existing between the whites and the
Indians; said they were brothers, and that the Indians
would never violate their treaty. He hoped both parties
would abide by it forever, and the peace and brotherly love
between them be as lasting as time. A shaking of hands
followed the speech, and the throng quietly dispersed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xix" id="chapter_xix">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The Indian sachems departed, and life in Chillicothe
fell back into its accustomed grooves.</p>

<p>Captain Bernard left for his Virginia home, but
Lyttleton remained a boarder at the General Anthony
Wayne, a self-appointed spy upon Kenneth's movements,
and very frequent visitor to the hospitable dwelling of
Major Lamar.</p>

<p>He continued to be a favorite with Clare, but found
scant favor with Nell, whose politeness was sometimes
freezing, while at others she would be only tolerably
gracious. She was constantly comparing him, and always
to his disadvantage, with Dr. Clendenin.</p>

<p>Lyttleton was handsome, polished, and an accomplished
conversationalist, but Kenneth was fully his
equal in these respects, and oh, how much more noble,
brave and true; what an earnest, unselfish, useful life he
led; how different from that of this gay idler who
seemed to have no thought of anything but his own ease
and pleasure!</p>

<p>She had about made up her mind that Lyttleton was a
coward, too, remembering how pale he had turned on his
first sight of Wawillaway, and having heard that he
showed great agitation at the roll of the drum which so
frightened the women and children with its false alarm
that the Indians were almost upon them.</p>

<p>And nothing else so excited Nell's scorn and contempt
as cowardice in a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Besides he now and then indulged in some remark
disparaging to Kenneth, insinuating that he was of low
birth and connections, less highly educated than himself,
unskillful in his profession, pharisaical in his religion, and
wanting in ease and refinement of manner.</p>

<p>All utterly false, as Nell knew; and she never failed
to retort with cutting sarcasm, stinging rebuke, or a
panegyric upon Dr. Clendenin so warm and earnest that
she recalled it afterward with burning blushes.</p>

<p>What if her words should reach Dr. Clendenin's ears!
What would he think of her, for with a sore heart she
was compelled to acknowledge to herself that eloquently
as his eyes had spoken once and again, his lips had
never yet breathed one word of love to her; and
not for worlds would she have him think she cared for
him.</p>

<p>But there was no danger that Lyttleton would report
their conversation; he would be loth indeed to give
Kenneth the pleasure of knowing how high he stood in
Miss Lamar's estimation, nor would he dare repeat his
own base innuendoes. It dawned upon him at length that
depreciation of his rival was not the best means of
ingratiating himself into the fair girl's favor, and he
changed his tactics, avoiding as far as possible all mention
of Dr. Clendenin's name in her presence.</p>

<p>But she neither forgot nor forgave what he had already
said, and in revenge threw out an occasional hint that
she had grave doubts of his own bravery, while at the
same time she lauded that of Dr. Clendenin to the skies.</p>

<p>Lyttleton was deeply mortified and cast about in his
mind for some way of proving to her that he was not
wanting in the manly attribute of courage.</p>

<p>"You seem to have an unbounded confidence in Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Clendenin's valor," he said one day in a tone of pique;
"pray tell me what he has ever done to prove it?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," she answered in grave, sweet accents,
but with kindling eyes and a slight smile hovering about
the lips, "I have seen it tried, or known it to be so, in many
ways during the several years of our acquaintance;&mdash;in
unhesitating exposure to contagious disease, in encounters
with the fierce wild beasts of our hills and forests, in
long lonely journeys out into the wilderness, all endured
without flinching.</p>

<p>"So much for his physical courage. His moral courage
is fully equal to it. He is not afraid or ashamed to show
his colors, to stand by his principles, to acknowledge his
allegiance to his divine Master by work or act, in whatever
company he finds himself. He is not afraid of ridicule,
of taunts or jeers, and I am sure would never hesitate
to espouse the cause of the downtrodden and
oppressed."</p>

<p>"I hate cant," said Lyttleton, coloring, "and never
could abide these people who set themselves up as so
much better than their neighbors."</p>

<p>"I entirely agree in those sentiments," replied Nell,
"and so would Dr. Clendenin. He never obtrudes his
sentiments or talks cant; and has a very humble opinion
of himself; yet his life is such, so pure, earnest, self-denying
and useful, that no one is left in doubt as to
whose servant he is: and oh, he knows how to speak
words of comfort and hope to the weak and weary, the sin-burdened
and sorrowing!"</p>

<p>"And permit me to add, is most fortunate in having
secured so fair and eloquent an advocate," returned
Lyttleton with a bow and a mocking smile; "yet I must
beg to be excused for my inability to see in him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
paragon of perfection your rose-colored glasses would
make him."</p>

<p>"If my glasses are rose-colored, permit me to say,
yours are evidently begrimed with London smoke,"
retorted Nell.</p>

<p>"You hate me because I am an Englishman," he said
gloomily; "and it is most unjust, since I had personally
nothing whatever to do with what you Americans are
pleased to style the oppressions of the mother country."</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I absolutely hate you, Mr. Lyttleton,"
she said meditatively, staying her needle in mid air
for an instant; "on the contrary I have occasionally found
your society not at all disagreeable; but," and the needle
again went swiftly in and out, while her eyes were fixed
upon her work, "I think if I were in need of a protector
from&mdash;any great immediate danger&mdash;an expected attack
by hostile Indians for instance, I should prefer one of my
countrymen by my side."</p>

<p>"Now, Nell, that was really too bad," remarked Clare,
after Lyttleton had gone. "The English are hardly less
brave as a nation than ourselves."</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't deny that, but he's an exception,
and deserving of all and more than I gave him for his
mean way of depreciating a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An absent rival," put in Clare with a laugh, as Nell
paused for an appellation suited to Kenneth's worth.
"Really I think you might forgive his evident jealousy,
which is certainly flattering to you."</p>

<p>"No, not a rival but a far better and nobler man than
himself," said the girl, the rose deepening on her
cheek.</p>

<p>Lyttleton went away full of anger and chagrin, and lay
awake half the night trying to contrive some means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
convincing Miss Lamar that no more valiant man than
himself was anywhere to be found.</p>

<p>He summoned his German valet at an unusually early
hour the next morning.</p>

<p>"Hans," said he, while the man was busied about his
person, "you are from Hesse, I think, and were over here
during the war?"</p>

<p>"Yass, mynheer, that ish so; but I dells it not to dese
peobles."</p>

<p>"No; of course not; and you need not fear that I
shall betray you. But your experience may enable you
to be of use to me in a new capacity."</p>

<p>"Vat ish dot, mynheer?"</p>

<p>"Have patience, Hans, and I will explain all in good
time. Were you an officer?"</p>

<p>"Nine, nine, mynheer; not so goot as dot; vat you
galls a brivateer?"</p>

<p>"A private, you blockhead," corrected Lyttleton, with
a laugh. "Well, I wish you had been higher, though,"
he added meditatively. "If I could but get hold of the
uniform of a Hessian officer, it would not matter now."</p>

<p>"Vell, mynheer, an' you gan keep von leedle segret, I
dinks dot gan be found?"</p>

<p>"What! here in this little out of the way village?"</p>

<p>Hans nodded wisely. "Yaas, I finds him pooty
quick."</p>

<p>"If you will do so and will make use of it as I direct,"
said Lyttleton, "you shall be handsomely paid for your
trouble. And may rest assured that I will never betray
your secret."</p>

<p>"Vell den, mynheer, I dell you, and I porrows de gloes,
and does de work. Karl Hedwig was in de war, an&mdash;vat
you call it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
"Officer?"</p>

<p>"Yaas, and he's got de soldier gloes."</p>

<p>"Now? Here?"</p>

<p>Hans answered in the affirmative, going on to explain
that Hedwig, whom he recognized as an old acquaintance,
and his former superior in the army, had begged
of him not to divulge the fact that he had served
against the Americans: fearing that it would render
him unpopular; but doubtless if it could be done without
incurring that risk, he would lend his uniform for a
consideration.</p>

<p>Lyttleton authorized Hans to hire it for the winter,
naming a liberal sum and enjoining secrecy.</p>

<p>"I expect to find use for it one of these days or nights,
which is all you need to know at present," he concluded.</p>

<p>Hans promised to attend to the commission promptly,
and with due care that none should know of it save Hedwig
and himself.</p>

<p>Godfrey Dale ran in to Major Lamar's that morning,
directly after breakfast, to say that the young people
were getting up a riding party for that afternoon, and to
ask Nell if he might be her escort.</p>

<p>"You must please excuse my coming at so early an
hour," he said, with a mischievous smile; "it was in order
to forestall the Englishman, who almost monopolizes you
of late, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"No, he does not," said Nell, looking but ill pleased.
"He is here a great deal, I know, but I cannot forbid him
the house."</p>

<p>"I left him in Clendenin's office," remarked Dale.
"He is generally to be found there when he is not here;
seems to admire the doctor prodigiously, tells me he has
conceived a very warm friendship for him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
"Then he is an arrant hypocrite!" exclaimed Nell,
her eyes flashing with indignation. "He is always saying
or hinting disparaging things of him to me."</p>

<p>Dale looked surprised, then angry, then laughed
lightly.</p>

<p>"To you, Miss Nell? Well, I suppose he dreads
Clendenin's rivalry, and thinks all is fair in love."</p>

<p>"I shall think but ill of you, Mr. Dale, if you uphold
him on any such plea as that," Nell said with vexation.</p>

<p>"Uphold him? No, indeed, Miss Nell. I only wish
to be as charitable as the case will allow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xx" id="chapter_xx">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Night was closing in dark and stormy after a day of
clouds and incessant rain, mingled with sleet and snow;
the wild November wind swept madly through the streets,
whistled, shrieked and roared in the wide chimneys and
through the forests, bending the trees with its furious
blast, and causing a solitary horseman to bow his head
almost to the saddle bow in the vain effort to shield his
face from the fierceness of its wrath.</p>

<p>"Courage, my brave Romeo, this has been a hard day
for you and me, but rest and shelter and food are not far
off now," he said, patting the neck of his steed with
gentle, caressing hand, as a temporary lull succeeded a
more than ordinarily fierce onset. They had crossed
the last prairie, threaded the mazes of the last forest, and
were close upon the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>It had, indeed, been a hard day, and the doctor was
cold, wet and hungry; icicles had gathered on hair and
beard, and the heavy overcoat he threw off on entering
his office was stiff with frozen rain.</p>

<p>Zeb had a bright fire blazing, and on his master's
entrance hastily lighted a candle and set it on the table.</p>

<p>"Ah, this looks comfortable," said Kenneth, shaking
off the icicles and drawing near the fire. "Hurry, Zeb,
and attend to Romeo. But first, has any one called?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah; de major lef' word you please step roun'
dar; one ob de chillen sick."</p>

<p>"Much the matter, Zeb?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
"Dunno, massa doctah; 'spec' you kin tell best 'bout
dat when you gets dar; yah, yah," and Zeb vanished.</p>

<p>I think Kenneth sighed a little inwardly, and cast a
somewhat regretful look upon the comforts he was leaving
behind, as he made ready again to face the storm,
donning a fur cap and a camelot cloak which he took
down from a nail in the wall.</p>

<p>As he threw it off in the hall at Major Lamar's, the
parlor door opened and a sweet voice said, "Come in,
doctor. It was really almost too bad to ask you to come
through this storm, and I think my brother regrets having
done so; for little Bertie does not seem to be seriously
ill now, though some hours ago he had quite a fever."</p>

<p>"Ah, I am glad to hear so good a report," Kenneth
said, taking the soft white hand held out to him, and
smiling down into the violet eyes. "But what sort of
doctor should you think me if I were afraid to face wind,
rain and sleet at the call of sickness?"</p>

<p>"Come to the fire and warm your hands," she said
lightly, ignoring his query; "they are much too cold for
the handling of my pet boy."</p>

<p>"You are right," he returned, holding them over the
blaze.</p>

<p>They stood there side by side for several minutes,
chatting on indifferent topics, the weather, the state of
the roads, cases of sickness in the town.</p>

<p>He thought he had never seen her look so lovely, the
beautiful, abundant hair gleaming like gold in the
glancing firelight, the full, red lips, the large liquid eyes,
so intensely blue, that now looked half shyly into his,
now drooped till the heavy silken fringes swept the
fair cheek whereon the soft color came and went with
every breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Her dress was simple, but extremely becoming, plain
gray in color, made with a long full skirt that fell in
soft folds about her graceful figure, and neatly-fitting
bodice, edged at neck and wrists with ruffles of delicate
lace.</p>

<p>Her only ornaments were a knot of pale blue ribbon in
her hair and another at her throat.</p>

<p>She was in one of her gentlest, most lovable moods,
and he could scarce control the impulse to catch her in
his arms, hold her to his heart, and cover the sweet face
with kisses.</p>

<p>But he must not, he dare not, and at that instant the
door opened and the major came in, carrying the sick
child, and followed by his wife.</p>

<p>"Ah, doctor, glad to see you; though, since this little
chap has suddenly changed so much for the better, I'm
more than half ashamed of having called you out in such
weather."</p>

<p>"No matter for that, major, it is no new thing for me
to face a storm," returned Kenneth, shaking hands with
Mrs. Lamar, then turning to examine his little patient.</p>

<p>Nell slipped away to the privacy of her own room for
a moment. Her cheeks were burning, her heart throbbed
wildly; she had read Kenneth's impulse in his speaking
countenance.</p>

<p>"He loves me, he does love me!" she murmured,
pacing hurriedly to and fro; "his eyes have said it over
and over again, but why does he always force back the
words that I can see are sometimes trembling on his very
lips, as though it were a sin to speak them? O Kenneth,
Kenneth, what, what is this separating wall between
us," she cried, leaning her burning brow against the
window frame and looking out into the storm and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
A fierce gust of wind sent the sleet with a furious dash
against the window pane and she shivered with a sudden
cold.</p>

<p>The room was fireless, for in those days it was not
thought necessary to heat any but the living rooms, and
the air was damp and chill.</p>

<p>But she could not go down again, not yet; and wrapping
herself in a thick shawl, she again paced silently to
and fro schooling her heart into calmness.</p>

<p>The summons to supper found her so far successful
that a slightly heightened color was the only remaining
trace of excitement.</p>

<p>Dr. Clendenin had accepted an urgent invitation to
remain and there was one other guest, a lady friend of
Mrs. Lamar, from one of the neighboring settlements.
She had been in Chillicothe a day or two and now found
herself storm-stayed.</p>

<p>They were a cheerful party, enjoying the light and
warmth and savory viands all the more for the cold,
darkness, and fierce warring of the elements without.</p>

<p>Nell seemed the gayest of the gay, full of mirth and
jest and brilliant repartee: but she avoided meeting
Kenneth's eye, while he saw every look, every movement
of hers, and when in passing an empty cup to be
refilled, their hands touched, it sent a sudden thrill
through both.</p>

<p>Kenneth was very weary and could not prevail upon
himself to decline a seat for the evening beside the
major's warm, hospitable hearth, nor refuse his eyes the
privilege of feasting upon Nell's beauty, his ears that of
drinking in each low sweet tone of her voice and the
silvery sound of her rippling laughter.</p>

<p>"Where's your master?" asked Dale, looking into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Kenneth's office, where Zeb was luxuriating in front of
a blazing, roaring fire, seated in the doctor's arm-chair,
hands in pockets, pipe in mouth and heels on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Gone to de major's, sah," answered the boy, bringing
his feet and the forelegs of the chair to the floor with a
loud thump, and removing the pipe, as he turned to look
at his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"He has, eh? and you're having a good time in his
absence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah, massa doctah neber grudge dat when de
work's done."</p>

<p>"No, I daresay not," and Dale drew back his head and
shut the door.</p>

<p>"Gone to the major's, eh!" he soliloquized as he
stepped back into his own den; "well I reckon I'm about
as storm proof as he, so I'll follow, not being in the mood
to appreciate solitude, and feeling that my hard day's
work merits the reward of a little rest and recreation."</p>

<p>Lyttleton had come to a like resolve and was at that
moment closeted in his own room with his valet, to whom
he seemed to have been giving some directions; his last
words as he wrapped himself in his cloak and went out,
were, "Come towards midnight, for though these people
accustom themselves to such confoundedly early
hours, I'll manage to keep them up for once, and follow
my orders implicitly. We could not have a more favorable
time, the darkness, the storm, why if spirits ever
walk abroad one would expect it to be on such a night
as this," he concluded with a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>"Dat ish so, mynheer, and I dinks von vill valk dese
shtreets pefore morning goomes," returned Hans, echoing
the laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Arrived at the major's, Dale found the family and
guests seated around the fire, the ladies on one side, the
gentlemen on the other.</p>

<p>The circle widened to admit him, Nell laughingly expressing
great surprise at seeing him on such a night.</p>

<p>"Well I don't know," he said, "why I should be supposed
less storm proof than the doctor here, and to tell
the truth, fair ladies, I couldn't endure the thought of
his basking in your smiles, while I sat alone in my dingy
office."</p>

<p>"You forget," said Kenneth, "how often the case has
been reversed, Godfrey. If you follow me up in this
fashion I shall never be even with you."</p>

<p>"Not at all necessary that you should, my good fellow,"
remarked Dale, toying with Nell's ball of yarn, for
she, as well as the other ladies, was knitting, and he had
drawn his chair close to hers, with a familiarity Kenneth
regarded with a jealous pang.</p>

<p>"Alas that he could not have forestalled Dale in this!
And did she care for Dale," he asked himself, watching
them without appearing to do so. How could he bear it
if she did? Yet better that by far, than seeing her in
the possession of Lyttleton.</p>

<p>His absence would be at least one advantage reaped
from the increasing fury of the storm. Lyttleton was
not a rugged pioneer like themselves, and would surely
remain closely housed until it had spent its wrath.</p>

<p>He was mistaken; scarcely had the thought passed
through his mind, when there came a loud rap upon the
outer door, quickly followed by the Englishman's entrance.</p>

<p>"What you, too, sir, out in this terrific storm!"
exclaimed Dale, not too well pleased, as the circle again
widened to admit the new comer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
"Why, yes," said Lyttleton, "I'm not a milk-sop, my
dear sir, and finding both the bar-room at the tavern
and my own apartment extremely dull, I ventured out,
trusting to a heavy cloak for protection from wind and
rain, and to the kind hospitality of these friends for a
welcome here."</p>

<p>"You are heartily welcome, sir," said the major;
"but draw up closer to the fire, for I am sorry to see
that the cloak has not proved a perfect protection from
the wet."</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;no; I found I had miscalculated, to some
extent, the force of the wind," laughed Lyttleton, with
a downward glance at his nether limbs, as he accepted
the invitation.</p>

<p>It was unworthy of Nell, but seized with a sudden
impulse to vex Kenneth, and excite his jealousy, by way
of revenge for his strange, his unaccountable silence
toward her, she seemed for the next hour scarcely conscious
of his presence, while at the same time she lavished
smiles, sweet looks, and pleasant words upon his two
rivals.</p>

<p>It did pain him sorely, though he gave no sign by
word or look, and the sharpest pang was the thought that
she was less noble and true, less worthy of the exalted
place she had hitherto held in his esteem, than he could
have believed.</p>

<p>But the storm grew wilder, the air was full of weird
and eerie sounds, and an awed, half fearful silence fell
upon the little company.</p>

<p>They drew their chairs nearer together, and Lyttleton,
breaking the silence, began telling legendary tales of
storm and flood in his own and other lands, following
them up with stories of second sight, of murder, suicide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
and ghostly visitants, fit to curdle the blood with
horror.</p>

<p>The lady guest and Mrs. Lamar, too, had some to
match these last, and though the major, the captain,
Kenneth and Dale, listened with incredulous looks and
smiles, it was with an interest that made them, as well as
the others, unconscious of the lapse of time till Dale,
glancing casually at the tall old clock ticking in a
corner, exclaimed that it was half past eleven.</p>

<p>Lyttleton had just finished one of his most thrilling
and horrible ghost stories, which had wrought up the
female portion of his audience, at least, into a state of
extreme nervous excitement; and at that instant there
came a blast that seemed to shake the house to its very
foundations, the door flew open, and in stalked a tall
Hessian in officer's uniform, drawing his sword and vociferating
loudly in his native tongue.</p>

<p>The ladies shrieked, the Hessian advanced toward the
major, brandishing his weapon, gesticulating wildly, and
yelling with a fury that drowned the noise of the raging
tempest!</p>

<p>The gentlemen seemed stunned with astonishment.
Lyttleton was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p>"Begone!" he cried, hastily placing himself so as to
shield Nell from the approach of the enraged foreigner,
and drawing a pistol from his pocket, "begone, sirrah, or
I will shoot you through the heart."</p>

<p>With that the Hessian turned about and beat a hasty
retreat, grumbling and swearing as he went.</p>

<p>Lyttleton stepped quickly to the door and secured it
after him, then returned to Nell's side to whisper with
triumphant air, "Ghost or mortal, I have driven the
wretch away, and you are safe, fair lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
The other two ladies, pale, trembling, half-fainting with
terror, hailed him gratefully as their deliverer; but Nell
had recovered from her fright in the very instant of uttering
the shriek called forth by the sudden apparition.</p>

<p>Was there not something familiar in the face, the form,
the stride with which he crossed the room?</p>

<p>She looked Lyttleton keenly in the eye, then returned
his whisper with another.</p>

<p>"Did it require any great stretch of courage to order
your valet out of the house?"</p>

<p>She had drawn her bow at a venture and was surprised
to see by his air of overwhelming confusion and chagrin,
that her arrow had sped straight to the mark.</p>

<p>"Your Hessian as sure as I stand here, sir!" cried
Captain Bernard, recovering himself and clapping the
major on the shoulder. "Well, well, I'll believe in ghosts
hereafter. I never was more astonished or taken aback
in my life. Lyttleton, you showed yourself the most
quick-witted and self-possessed of any of us. Allow me
to congratulate you on the laurels you have won."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" stammered Lyttleton with a deprecating
glance at Nell, whose lips were curling with scorn.</p>

<p>"We will spare your modesty," said the major, grasping
the Englishman's hand warmly, "but let me tender
you the thanks of the company."</p>

<p>Lyttleton was strangely confused and embarrassed;
the ease and perfect self-possession on which he so prided
himself, had on a sudden entirely forsaken him; he
darted a quick, imploring glance at Nell, and half in pity,
half in contempt she returned an answering look that
told him his secret was safe.</p>

<p>The others saw this by-play with varied feelings of
wonder, curiosity and surprise, but no one understood it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Captain Bernard was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, it is growing very late and no prospect
of abatement of the storm. I move that we adjourn
<i>sine die</i>. Mr. Lyttleton, shall I have the pleasure of your
good company to our hotel?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxi" id="chapter_xxi">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Never had scheme more signal failure than that of
Lyttleton for convincing pretty Nell Lamar of his dauntless
bravery; he went away from the major's that night
crestfallen and angry, cursing his ill-luck and her quickness
of perception.</p>

<p>Nor was fair Nell herself in a much more enviable
state of mind; there was a sad, reproachful look in Kenneth's
eyes as he bade her a courteous good-night, which
haunted her for days and weeks like a nightmare.</p>

<p>She purposely avoided him when he called the next
morning to enquire about Bertie, and when the weather
permitted her to resume her walks and rides, was careful
to select those in which she was least likely to meet
him.</p>

<p>He was not slow to perceive this and it wounded him
deeply; particularly as Lyttleton was very frequently
her companion and his society seemed not unpleasant to
her, if one might judge from her bright looks and smiles.</p>

<p>Yet Nell despised Lyttleton heartily, and at times herself
scarcely less.</p>

<p>"Nell Lamar, you are becoming an arrant and shameless
coquette!" she would exclaim almost fiercely to herself
in the privacy of her own room. "I'm ashamed of you!
no wonder Dr. Clendenin looks at you as if he despaired
of you and pitied you for your depravity. Well, whose
fault is it but his; why do his lips refuse to speak what
his eyes have said over and over again? Oh, it is mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and shameful! I will not care for him or his reproving
looks! He is no better than I, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;O
Kenneth, Kenneth, you are good and noble and true,
though I cannot understand it!"</p>

<p>Thus she was by turns angry and repentant, now
reproaching him, and now herself.</p>

<p>She did not, however, give Lyttleton much encouragement.
As she had said to Dale, she could not forbid him
the house, neither could she avoid being in the same
room with him when there, as no other, the kitchen
excepted, was warm enough for comfort at that inclement
season, nor could she prevent his joining her in the
street.</p>

<p>She usually declined his attentions when it could be
done without positive rudeness, yet he persevered, the
prize seeming to him all the more valuable because of
its difficulty of acquisition.</p>

<p>Dale looked on with vexation and a growing dislike
to Lyttleton; but Clare gave the latter her countenance,
making him always welcome to the house, saying little
things that flattered his vanity, and vaguely hinting that
Nell was capricious and might be won in time by clever
courting.</p>

<p>The major was apparently oblivious of the whole matter,
while the gossips of the town compared notes and
speculated as to the probability that the Englishman's
suit would eventually prosper.</p>

<p>These queries and conjectures now and then reached
Kenneth's ears, inflicting a sharp pang all unsuspected
by the talkers; for it had come to be the popular opinion
that Dr. Clendenin was a confirmed bachelor, utterly
indifferent to the charms of the softer sex; and not by
word or tone, or so much as a change in the calm gravity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
of his demeanor, did he let them into the secret of his
silent suffering.</p>

<p>And it was not slight; many a night of sleepless
anguish it cost him to think how "his darling, his own
precious little Nell," as he must call her, was being
wiled away from him by one who could never, he was
sure, half appreciate her worth, and was far from deserving
so rich a prize.</p>

<p>But could it be possible that she would throw herself
away thus, that she would give her hand without her
heart? For was not that all his own, had not those beautiful,
eloquent eyes betrayed her secret to him spite of
herself? And yet, and yet&mdash;had he, beyond a doubt or
peradventure, read that look aright? Oh, if he might but
go to her, pour out the story of his love and sue for hers?
But alas, alas, he dare not, 'twould be a more grievous
wrong than to keep silent and let her think what she
would of him.</p>

<p>And though he longed continually for her sweet
society, though he felt as if shut out of a heaven on
earth while staying away from her dear presence, he must
constrain himself to do so, always have some excuse
ready when the major urged upon him the hospitalities
of his house.</p>

<p>And what right had he to accuse the dear girl in his
heart of fickleness and coquetry? He, and he alone, was
to blame for her conduct, because his looks had told the
story of his love and his lips failed to confirm it.</p>

<p>There was, perhaps, more than usual sociability among
the young people of Chillicothe that winter, and Lyttleton
was invited everywhere, generally accepting; always
when he knew that Miss Lamar would be one of the
guests; and not unfrequently she was much vexed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the marked attention he was pleased to bestow upon
her.</p>

<p>Some of the other young ladies would have received
them with far more complacency, deeming the handsome,
fascinating, and apparently wealthy Englishman
no mean prize in the matrimonial lottery.</p>

<p>Of course Nell was teased and jested with about her
adorer, but to the surprise of the well-meaning jokers,
their witticisms were received with hauteur, and sometimes
positive anger, leaving no room for doubt that
the subject was an unpleasant one.</p>

<p>Still most of them made up their minds that it was
only their remarks that were so distasteful to her, and
not the man himself, or his evident predilection.</p>

<p>Nell usually enjoyed the sleigh rides, the quiltings,
the social tea-drinkings, and evening parties which constituted
the winter festivities of the town, and was the
life of them all; but this season she was glad to get
away from them, or rather from Lyttleton's society,
to the quiet and seclusion of Mr. Nash's farm-house, to
which she was carried off by its mistress one bright
December morning, for a fortnight's visit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash had come into town to exchange butter
and eggs for dry goods and groceries. That done she
called at the major's, proposed to Nell to take a vacant
seat in her sleigh, and return with her, and was delighted
by a prompt acceptance of the invitation.</p>

<p>"I don't know how Mr. Lyttleton will be able to
endure so long a separation," remarked Clare demurely.</p>

<p>"And I don't care!" returned Nell, with spirit. "I
shall enjoy it extremely, and selfish as it may seem, that
is all I am concerned about."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
"How about Dr. Clendenin?" queried Mrs. Nash
with a roguish smile.</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed, then paled.</p>

<p>"He is seldom here and will not miss me," she said in
a quiet tone as she left the room to make the necessary
preparations for the trip.</p>

<p>"Your English friend will be sure to follow you," said
Clare as they bade good-bye.</p>

<p>"He would not dare!" cried Nell. "But don't you
let him know where I am, for there is no saying how
far his audacity may carry him."</p>

<p>"Quite as far as you travel to-day, I've no doubt,"
laughed Clare.</p>

<p>"Nell," said Mrs. Nash, as they glided swiftly over
the snow, leaving the town behind. "I hear that Englishman
is very attentive to you; but I can tell you Dr.
Clendenin is worth a dozen of him."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with it?" asked Nell dryly,
screening her face from view in the folds of a thick veil.
"They are not rivals."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, my dear child. I do
know that Dr. Clendenin loves you."</p>

<p>"He has made you his confidante?"</p>

<p>Nell's tone was a mixture of inquiry, pain, incredulity,
anger and pique.</p>

<p>"Not intentionally; but words could not have told it
more plainly than his looks, tones and actions when he
found you lying insensible beside the carcass of that
mad cat, and thought you had been bitten."</p>

<p>"All your imagination, <i>mon ami</i>, Dr. Clendenin and
I are nothing to each other."</p>

<p>Nell strove to speak lightly, but there was an undertone
of bitterness which did not escape her friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mrs. Nash mused silently for a moment, saying to herself
there had probably been a lovers' quarrel, but she
hoped it would all come right in the end, and she would
be on the lookout to do anything in her power to bring
about a reconciliation.</p>

<p>She was not one of the prying kind, however, and
knew that Nell would be quick to resent any attempt to
worm her secrets from her, so when she presently spoke
again, it was upon a widely different topic.</p>

<p>They had a pleasant sociable time together for several
days, Nell finding positive pleasure in helping her friend
to make up winter garments for the children.</p>

<p>Then came a heavy snow storm followed by bright
weather, clear and cold, making excellent sleighing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash had carefully avoided broaching the subject
of Nell's love affairs, but they had, nevertheless, been
seldom absent from her thoughts, which had busied themselves
with projects for restoring harmony between the
two, whom she supposed to have had a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>She had cast about in her mind for an excuse for sending
for the doctor, that so they might be brought
together and given an opportunity for mutual explanation.
So anxious for this was she that it seemed hardly
a matter for regret when she found she had taken cold
with the change of weather, and had a slight sore throat.</p>

<p>Mr. Nash was going into town and she requested him
to call at the doctor's office and ask him to come out
and see her.</p>

<p>Nell heard, and it sent the blood to her cheek and
made her heart beat quickly. She had not exchanged a
word with Dr. Clendenin since that evening when she
had read, or fancied she did, reproof in his eye and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
voice because of her flirtation with Lyttleton; and she
both longed and dreaded to meet him.</p>

<p>The latter feeling increased as the time drew near
when he might be expected; the merry jingle of sleigh
bells, and the sight of a cutter with a gentleman in it
wrapped in furs, dashing up to the gate, had almost sent
her flying from the room, so strong was the impulse at
that moment to avoid him.</p>

<p>But a second glance told her that was not Kenneth's
noble figure which sprang from the vehicle and came
hurrying up the path to the house.</p>

<p>She sat still and in another moment Lyttleton stood
smiling and bowing before her, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Excuse this intrusion, fair lady," he said, "I have
felt like a Peri shut out of heaven since your withdrawal
from the major's house, and I come as bearer of a letter
which I must even hope may secure me a welcome."</p>

<p>He tendered it gracefully as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah, thank you!" she cried, her face flushing with
pleasure, for letters were a rare thing in those days.</p>

<p>He bade her read it while he sat by the fire and chatted
with Mrs. Nash, to whom, with his usual tact and
skill, he soon managed to make himself extremely entertaining.</p>

<p>"Now, fair lady," he said, turning to Nell as she
refolded her letter, "may I not claim a reward for the
slight service I have had the happiness to render you?"</p>

<p>"Of what kind, sir?" she answered with a saucy
smile.</p>

<p>"The privilege of taking you out for a short drive.
The sleighing is superb."</p>

<p>Nell was in a most gracious mood, and then here was
the wished for chance to escape the dreaded meeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
with Dr. Clendenin. She consented at once and hastily
donned cloak and hood.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will find it very cold," objected Mrs.
Nash, more anxious to detain the young girl for Kenneth's
coming, and to prevent any acceptance of attentions
from his rival, than she would have liked to
acknowledge.</p>

<p>"Oh no, madame," hastily interposed Lyttleton, "I
have a foot-stove and plenty of robes, and there is no
wind; indeed I assure you it is quite delightful out to-day,
the air is so pure and bracing."</p>

<p>"And I am warmly dressed, and have a thick veil,"
added Nell.</p>

<p>Lyttleton tucked the robes snugly about her, saying,
"I trust you will not suffer from cold, Miss Lamar."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she answered with a gay laugh.</p>

<p>"Now which way shall we travel?" he asked, gathering
up the reins.</p>

<p>With the thought that Dr. Clendenin would be coming
from the town, and the desire to avoid a meeting, Nell
named the opposite direction.</p>

<p>But they had not gone half a mile when that very
thing occurred.</p>

<p>Dr. Clendenin had a patient some miles farther out
from town, had called there first, and was intending to
take Mr. Nash's in his way home.</p>

<p>He bowed with grave courtesy to Nell and her companion,
in passing, recognizing the latter with a jealous
pang that was like the stab of a sharp knife.</p>

<p>Nell's cheeks flushed and her eyes fell; she was thankful
that her veil hid her agitation from Dr. Clendenin;
but then and many times through the succeeding weeks
and months, she would have given much to deny to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
the knowledge that she had accepted this attention from
Lyttleton.</p>

<p>In vain she asked herself what concern was it of his,
what right he had to object? She could not shake off the
feeling that she was in some way, to some extent,
accountable to him.</p>

<p>From that day she was as ready with excuses as Kenneth
himself when the only alternative was to permit
Lyttleton to be her escort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxii" id="chapter_xxii">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Lyttleton cordially hated Clendenin, but endeavored
to conceal his dislike and ill-will under the mask of
friendship, haunting the doctor's office all through the
winter and spring with nearly as great persistency as
during the first week of his sojourn in Chillicothe.</p>

<p>He indulged a like feeling toward Dale, though to a
less degree; hating him as a rival in love, Kenneth as
that and something more.</p>

<p>Spring opened early. Bright, warm days with hard
frosts at night made the sap in the sugar maples run
freely, and many farmers in the vicinity of the town were
busied in catching and boiling it down. Then visits to
the sugar camps became one of the popular amusements
of the young people.</p>

<p>Dale got up a party to go on horseback to one
five or six miles away, inviting Lyttleton, but taking care
first to secure to himself the honor of playing escort to
Miss Lamar.</p>

<p>Lyttleton was very angry when he learned this, but
having promised to go, tried to console himself with the
young lady he considered next to Nell in beauty and
fascination.</p>

<p>He managed to conceal his ill humor, the others
seemed in high spirits, and they had a merry time.</p>

<p>In returning they made a circuit through the woods.
They were following the course of a little stream when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Dale, who was taking the lead, suddenly gave a loud
"Hurrah!"</p>

<p>"What is it? what is it?" cried the others, hurrying
up.</p>

<p>"A bear's stepping place," he answered gleefully,
pointing to some deep indentations in the soft, spongy
ground; evidently the tracks of some large wild animal,
and leading off from the water's edge into the woods.</p>

<p>"A bear!" cried Lyttleton, horrified, "then let us
hurry these ladies home with all speed."</p>

<p>"Not much danger, sir," remarked a young fellow
named Bell; "bears are lazy at this time of year, and we
all have our guns. If the ladies are not afraid, I'd like
very much to follow up the track and see where his
bearship lodges."</p>

<p>"So should I," said Dale. "However, we can note the
spot and return to it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"No, lead on; I'm not afraid," cried Nell. "He's
likely to be in his hole any how, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; unless he's on his way to the water here, for a
drink. They come after that about once in two or three
days."</p>

<p>A consultation was held, and a majority being in
favor of following up the track, they did so, finding it
led them to a large hollow tree distant some few hundred
yards in the depths of the wood.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen of the bear himself, but the young
men, familiar with his habits, made no doubt that he was
inside the tree, and promised themselves fine sport in
hunting him out, and a grand feast upon his flesh; the
fat part of which is said to make a very luxurious repast
when boiled or roasted with turkey or venison.</p>

<p>Bell proposed to climb the tree, which was rough and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
knotted, and look into the hole; but to that the ladies
objected.</p>

<p>So they turned about and went home, the young men
arranging on the way for the proposed hunt.</p>

<p>The next day, their number augmented by the addition
of Major Lamar and Dr. Clendenin, they returned
to the spot.</p>

<p>Bell, armed with a long pole sharpened at one end,
climbed the tree, the others looking on near by, each
with his gun loaded and ready for instant use.</p>

<p>"Here he is," cried Bell, peeping in at the hole in the
tree. "Out o' this, Sir Bruin! out I say!" prodding
the creature with his stick as he spoke.</p>

<p>The beast uttered a low growl, but did not move.
But Bell continued to punch, prick and order him out,
until finally he obeyed, moving heavily to the hole and
slowly dragging himself out.</p>

<p>As soon as he was fairly clear of the hole, Dale and the
major, who had been selected for the duty, fired; taking
aim so accurately that the animal fell dead instantly.</p>

<p>Tig, Zeb and Hans were directed to take care of the
carcass.</p>

<p>Bell, who upon starting the bear had slipped out on to
a large limb and nonchalantly awaited the shooting,
dropped to the ground and with the rest of the hunters
moved on in search of other game.</p>

<p>"You are a daring fellow," observed Lyttleton admiringly,
to Bell. "I was really alarmed for your safety."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't feel myself in much danger," returned
Bell, with a light laugh; "for you see I had time to slip
aside, after starting him, before he could get clear of the
hole, and I knew Dale and the major would not miss
their mark."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
The party had traversed some miles of forest, shooting
several deer and a number of wild turkeys, when they
came upon the "stepping place" of another bear, and
then upon bruin himself returning from the stream where
he had been slaking his thirst.</p>

<p>This one was of less amiable disposition, or wider
awake than the first, and when Lyttleton, who happened
to be nearest, fired at it, aiming so carelessly in his
haste and excitement that he only wounded without disabling
it, the creature turned, rushed at him in fury and
rose on its hind legs prepared to give him a hug which
would have left no breath in his body.</p>

<p>But there was a sharp report, a bullet whizzed past
him, almost grazing his cheek, entered the creature's
eye, penetrating to the brain, and it dropped dead at his
feet.</p>

<p>He staggered back pale and trembling.</p>

<p>"You are not hurt?" asked Kenneth's voice close at
his side.</p>

<p>"Yes; no&mdash;I&mdash;I can hardly tell."</p>

<p>"Well done, doc!" cried the major, running up to
them; "he's a big, powerful fellow," looking down at
the bear, "and could have given a tremendous squeeze,
such as would crush a man's bones to bits. Lyttleton,
I think Dr. Clendenin has saved your life."</p>

<p>Lyttleton stammered out some words of thanks, then
moved away muttering to himself, "Confound the thing,
he's the last man I'd willingly owe such a debt to!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxiii" id="chapter_xxiii">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Spring deepened into summer and still Lyttleton
lingered in Chillicothe, though with no apparent object
unless it might be the hope of winning Miss Lamar.
He continued to be a constant visitor at the major's,
welcomed by him and Clare, but seeing little of Nell,
who took particular pains to avoid him, by going out
at such times as he was likely to call, or busying herself
in another part of the house when he was in the parlor.</p>

<p>He noticed this with anger and chagrin, yet as we
have said, difficulty of attainment only increased his
estimate of the value of the prize he sought; and suspecting,
in his egregious self-conceit and egoism, her
conduct to he merely an affectation of coyness with the
purpose to bring him to a formal declaration of love,
for how could any woman resist such fascination as his
of person, manner and fortune, he determined to seize
the first opportunity to make her an offer of heart and
hand.</p>

<p>With that end in view he dropped in one day at the
major's just at tea time; ostensibly for the purpose of
inquiring if they had heard a piece of news that was
creating some little excitement in the town, and sure of
an invitation to stay and partake with them of the evening
meal.</p>

<p>The news was concerning Wawillaway's assassin, the
dastardly ruffian Wolf. He had fled to Kentucky
to escape the merited punishment of his crime at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the hands of the two sons of the murdered chief, who,
in accordance with the Indian code, making it the right
and duty of the nearest of kin to kill the slayer of their
relative, had vowed vengeance upon him.</p>

<p>The murderer may, however, purchase his life at a
price agreed upon by the family of his victim, and Wolf
had employed an agent to make terms with the two
young men.</p>

<p>It was now announced that these terms had been
agreed upon, and the business would be concluded by
an interesting ceremony at Old Town, to take place the
following day.</p>

<p>Lyttleton had heard several gentlemen say they meant
to be present and to take their wives or sweethearts
with them, and had determined that he too would go,
if possible as Miss Lamar's escort.</p>

<p>But Dale had the start of him this time, as on several
former occasions, and was already in the major's parlor,
discussing the news with the family, and engaged to
conduct Miss Nell to see the ceremony, when Lyttleton
came in; as the latter presently learned from the conversation.</p>

<p>He was disappointed and angry, but so sure of success
in his more important errand that he comforted
himself with the thought that this was Dale's last chance
to serve him such a trick.</p>

<p>Dale, for his part, had no idea that any such calamity
awaited Nell or himself, and having a little urgent business
matter to attend to, went away shortly after tea to
which both callers had been hospitably invited, in a
very cheerful frame of mind, leaving the field to Lyttleton.</p>

<p>He knew the Englishman to be a rival, but did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
consider him a dangerous one; and at all events Nell
was secured to himself for the coming day.</p>

<p>Clare, though at one time quite sure that Dr. Clendenin
and Nell cared for each other, had now entirely
given up the idea of ever seeing them united. She
could not worm out the facts from Nell, but concluded
that there must have been an irreconcilable quarrel.</p>

<p>"Well, she was not sorry, for this Englishman was
certainly very much in love, and would make a better
match, from a worldly point of view at least." So she
did what lay in her power to favor and advance his
suit.</p>

<p>Something in his look or manner told her of his purpose
to-night, and she contrived that the two should be
left alone in the parlor soon after Dale's departure.</p>

<p>Lyttleton seized the opportunity at once, poured out
passionate expressions of love, and in plain words asked
Nell to become his wife.</p>

<p>She tried in vain to stop him, he would be heard to
the end.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lyttleton," she said, rising with flushed cheeks
and sparkling eyes, "I thank you for the honor you have
done me, but I cannot entertain such a proposition for
a moment. Nay, hear me out," as he seemed about to
enter a protest, "even as you have compelled me to hear
you. I would have spared you the pain of a rejection,
but you would not let me."</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Nell&mdash;Miss Lamar," he stammered,
"it cannot be that I hear aright! or if I do that you
understand what it is that you are rejecting. I will say
nothing"&mdash;with an affectation of humility&mdash;"of any
charms of person or address that some may attribute to
your humble servant, but an honored and ancient name,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
an assured position among the English gentry, fine
estate, large fortune&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him, drawing herself up to her full
height, while her eyes flashed and her cheek crimsoned
with indignation.</p>

<p>"If I ever marry, Mr. Lyttleton, it shall be neither
position nor estate&mdash;least of all money."</p>

<p>"What more can you ask, pray?" he inquired, folding
his arms and throwing back his head with an air of
hauteur.</p>

<p>"Something of infinitely greater worth," she replied,
her eyes kindling, "infinitely better and higher; the
love and confidence of a true and noble heart, the
heart of a man who lives not for himself, but for
others, who is not content to pass his days in inglorious
ease and idleness, but does with his might what his
hands find to do to glorify God and benefit his fellow
men."</p>

<p>"Clendenin, curse him!" he muttered between his
clinched teeth.</p>

<p>Her quick ear caught the words not meant for it.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with a peculiar smile, "Dr. Clendenin
answers the description very well, but not he alone; I
am thankful to say there are others among my countrymen
who do."</p>

<p>"Your countrymen! always your countrymen," he
blazed out growing very red and angry; "a set of
clodhoppers who are obliged to earn their bread by
the sweat of their brows. Mark my words, miss,
you'll see the day when you would be very glad to
share the inglorious ease of a member of the favored
class denominated the English gentry."</p>

<p>"No, sir," she answered with spirit, "I am heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and soul an American, and our differing nationalities
would be an insuperable objection to the acceptance of
your offer were there none other."</p>

<p>At which, boiling with rage and disappointment, he
hastily caught up his hat and left the house.</p>

<p>Nell's conscience pricked her with the reminder that
those last words were untrue; since, had Lyttleton been
an American, and Kenneth an Englishman, it would
have made no difference in her feelings toward either.</p>

<p>Lyttleton hurried on through the streets and out into
the country beyond, neither knowing nor caring in his
rage and disappointment what direction he took. All
he wanted was to avoid observation until he could
recover his accustomed self-control; lest otherwise the
story of his rejection should be bruited about and himself
treated to scorn and ridicule in consequence.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he struck into the trail that led to Old
Town.</p>

<p>The sun had set, but there was yet sufficient light to
show him the stalwart figure of a huntsman with his gun
on his shoulder and a string of birds in his hand, coming
to meet him.</p>

<p>Lyttleton stood still for a moment, debating in his
own mind whether to go on or to retrace his steps,
when the other called out in a well-known voice,</p>

<p>"Dat you, mynheer? It ish goot you haf come. I
have some dings der dell you."</p>

<p>"What things, Hans?" asked Lyttleton moving on to
meet his valet, to whom he had given permission for a
day's sport in the woods.</p>

<p>"I dells you pooty quick, mynheer," returned Hans
close at his side; then went on to relate how he had
fallen in with a party of Indians on their way to Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Town to take part in the coming ceremony, and that they
had among them a white woman who seemed, from her
looks and actions, to have been with them a long while.</p>

<p>Lyttleton listened eagerly, and when Hans had
finished his story, tried to elicit further information by
asking questions in regard to the height, complexion,
demeanor, and apparent age of the woman.</p>

<p>When these had all been answered. "It may be
she," he said musingly as if thinking aloud; then in a
quick, determined way, "Hans, you must take me at
once to see this woman. It may prove of the greatest
importance that I should see and talk with her this
very night."</p>

<p>Hans, already weary and footsore with his day's
tramp, would have greatly preferred to move on to
Chillicothe and get a warm supper at the General
Anthony Wayne, followed by a lounge on the bench
before the bar-room door. Accordingly he showed some
unwillingness to obey the order.</p>

<p>It was, however, speedily overcome by the offer of
double wages for that week. He turned about at once
and by the light of the moon, just rising over the tree
tops, the two followed the trail till it brought them to
the Indian town, where after some search they found
the object of their quest seated alone at the door of her
wigwam, smoking a pipe and seemingly wrapped in
meditation, enjoying the moonlight and the cool evening
breeze which was particularly refreshing after the day.</p>

<p>Lyttleton accosted her courteously in English, and
she answered in the same tongue, inviting him to take a
seat on the bearskin by her side.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do not wish to crowd you, I will sit
here," he said, appropriating a stump close at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Hans, by his master's direction, had refrained from
approaching very near, and was resting himself on a
fallen tree a few hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>He saw that Lyttleton and the woman were soon in
earnest conversation, but could not hear the words
spoken.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians were nearer, but few of them had
any knowledge of English, the language used by both
speakers during the interview, most of them none at all,
and only from looks, tones and gestures, could they
gather any hint of the subject of the conference.</p>

<p>It lasted for a full hour; then Lyttleton rose and stood
before the woman, talking and gesticulating with great
earnestness. He seemed to be vehemently urging some
request which she was inclined to deny; at length he
drew out a silken purse full of broad gold pieces which
glittered in the moonlight as he held it up.</p>

<p>"Promise me," he said, "and this is yours; keep
your promise till I see you again and it shall be
doubled."</p>

<p>"Give it me then," she cried, stretching out an eager
hand.</p>

<p>"You promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; why not?"</p>

<p>He dropped it into her open palm, saying impressively,
"Remember. Now, good-bye," and turned exultingly
to go on his way.</p>

<p>"Stay," she cried.</p>

<p>"Well, what more?" he asked facing her again, "is it
not enough?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but you have not told me who you are, or why
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It does not matter; all you have to do is to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
my directions," he interrupted somewhat haughtily, and
strode rapidly away.</p>

<p>"Your errand shpeed so petter as goot, mynheer?"
queried Hans as they struck into the trail again.</p>

<p>"I flatter myself it will all come out right in the end,
Hans," was the reply; then there was a muttered word
or two that sounded like an imprecation upon some
absent person, with a threat of vengeance for some real
or fancied injury.</p>

<p>Chillicothe seemed sleeping when they re-entered it;
the streets were silent and deserted, the houses closed
and dark; only from the bar-room window of the General
Anthony Wayne gleamed the light of a single tallow
candle. Master and man entered there without noise or
bustle and presently slipped quietly away to the room of
the former.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxiv" id="chapter_xxiv">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Curiosity was rife in Chillicothe and its vicinity in
regard to the ceremony about to take place at Old
Town, and as the set time drew near very many whites
of both sexes might have been seen approaching the
spot, singly or in parties.</p>

<p>Clendenin, hindered by the demands of his profession,
was one of the last to arrive on the ground.</p>

<p>He found the Indians drawn up in a hollow square,
outside of which was the concourse of white spectators,
inside Wolf with his promised bribe,&mdash;a horse, a new
saddle and bridle, and a new rifle for each of the sons of
his victim.</p>

<p>Kenneth had come alone. He knew that Dale had
preceded him, and whom he was to escort thither, and
there they were on the opposite side of the square; Nell
in a becoming riding hat and habit, sitting her horse
with accustomed ease and grace; Dale by her side, the
picture of content and good humor.</p>

<p>Kenneth sighed involuntarily; what would he not
have given to be in Dale's place, yet he was glad to see
his friend so favored rather than the Englishman.</p>

<p>The next moment he perceived that Lyttleton also
was one of the assembled throng; at some little distance
from those two, but in a position to get a good view of
their faces, and that he was watching them closely, with
a look of jealous rage.</p>

<p>Kenneth's eyes turned to Nell again to see hers fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
for an instant upon the burly form and ruffianly face of
Wolf, with an expression of disgust and horror.</p>

<p>But the ceremony was beginning, and for a little
claimed the attention of all present.</p>

<p>The two young men came forward into the hollow
square, Wolf presented his horses and trappings, they
lifted their hands toward heaven invoking the Great
Spirit, and declaring that to Him alone they transferred
the blood and life of Wolf forfeited by the death of their
father.</p>

<p>They then shook hands with Wolf in token of their
forgiveness, saluted him as a brother, and lighting the
calumet of peace, smoked with him in the presence of
the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>The scene was one of deep solemnity and many eyes
filled with tears as they gazed upon it.</p>

<p>But it was over and the crowd began to disperse,
tongues were loosed, and Kenneth, silently threading his
way among the talkers, casually overheard the remark,
"There is a white woman here, they say, who has been a
great many years with the Indians."</p>

<p>He almost caught his breath for an instant as he suddenly
reined in his horse, his heart beating like a hammer,
a wild hope springing up within his breast, a rush
of mingled emotions surging through his brain.</p>

<p>Strange that he had not thought of such a possibility.</p>

<p>He turned back, dismounted and secured his horse to
a sapling; doing it all mechanically. Then he strolled
about among the Indians, shaking hands with them and
kindly inquiring after their health and that of their
families, patting the heads of the papooses, nodding
smilingly to the older children, and scanning with furtive,
but keen scrutiny, the face of each elderly squaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
At length he came upon the object of his search, a
woman past middle age, whose features were unmistakably
those of the white race.</p>

<p>She sat on the grass in the shade of a tree, near the
door of a wigwam, her fingers busily employed in
embroidering a moccasin.</p>

<p>She seemed scarcely aware of his presence as he stood
before her vainly striving to still the tumultuous beating
of his heart.</p>

<p>Controlling his voice by a great effort, he addressed
her in English, in a quiet tone.</p>

<p>"How do you do, mother?"</p>

<p>She looked up for an instant, shook her head slowly,
and dropped her eyes upon her work again.</p>

<p>"You understand me?" he said inquiringly, "you
have not forgotten your native tongue?"</p>

<p>"Me squaw," was the laconic answer, unaccompanied
by so much as a glance.</p>

<p>He sat down on a stump near at hand, the very same
on which Lyttleton had seated himself the previous
night, and watched her silently for a moment, while he
considered the best manner of approaching her so as to
win her confidence and learn whether she could indeed
tell him aught of that which all these years he had been
trying to discover.</p>

<p>"You are a white woman, why should you wish to conceal
the fact?" he said at length in a soft, persuasive
tone. "I have no design against you, but on the contrary
would gladly do you any service in my power."</p>

<p>Again she raised her head, this time giving him a
steady look, and was it fancy that for a single instant
there was something like a gleam of recognition in her
eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
If so it was gone again before he could be sure it had
been there; while she answered indifferently in the
Shawnee tongue, that she did not understand what he
had just said, and that she was not a pale face but an
Indian woman, the wife of a Shawnee brave.</p>

<p>Kenneth sat for a moment in perplexed silence; her
assertion that she did not belong to the white race was
evidently false, yet what could be her motive for making
it? If she preferred to remain with the tribe no
one could force her away, or would be likely to care
to do so.</p>

<p>As he watched her again busied with her work, apparently
wholly careless of his presence, and studied her
face, recalling the description that had been given him,
calculating what her age might be, and the changes produced
by the hardships and exposure of her wild life,
the conviction grew upon him that it was possible, even
probable, she was the very woman for whom he had so
long and vainly searched.</p>

<p>He determined upon a bold course.</p>

<p>Leaning toward her and gazing full into her face,
"Reumah Clark," he said, "have you quite forgotten the
old life in the little valley among the mountains of Eastern
Tennessee, the husband and children you then
loved so dearly, the kind neighbors at whose house you
were when the Indians swooped down so suddenly upon
you all?"</p>

<p>She had not been able to repress a slight start at the
unexpected sound of that name, or to entirely preserve the
stolidity of countenance with which she had begun the
interview.</p>

<p>She rose hastily and disappeared from view within the
wigwam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
The action left in Kenneth's mind little room for doubt
of her identity, but alas, of what avail that he had found
her, if she could not be induced to speak of those
long past occurrences and to reveal the secret which, if
known to any mortal, was possessed by her alone?</p>

<p>His heart beat almost to suffocation while he forced
himself to sit waiting quietly there at the door of her
wigwam in the forlorn hope that she might return in a
truthful and communicative mood.</p>

<p>He was alone, no one near, though at the distance of
a few hundred yards, the young Indians were engaged in
active sports and their shouts and laughter occasionally
broke the stillness of the woodland scene.</p>

<p>He waited what seemed an age to his tortured nerves,
perceiving neither sound nor motion within the tent,
then rose and moved slowly toward the spot where he
had left his faithful steed.</p>

<p>He had not quite reached it when a hand was laid
lightly upon his arm, and turning he found a tall young
brave standing by his side.</p>

<p>"Does the pale face forget?" he asked in good English,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Have we ever met before?" asked Kenneth, earnestly
scanning the lad's face, while he took the hand in a cordial
grasp and shook it heartily.</p>

<p>"Indians never forget good white men," continued the
lad, "white man find Little Horn in the snow, take him
in his arms, carry him to his fire, wrap him in his blanket,
feed him. White man very good. Indian boy love good
white man."</p>

<p>"Oh I remember you now!" cried Kenneth, joyfully,
shaking hands with increased cordiality, while his face
lighted up with his rare, beautiful smile. "I am glad to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
meet you again. Tell me, can I do anything more for
you?"</p>

<p>"Little Horn's turn now. What would my friend with
White Swan, the warrior Black Eagle's squaw?"</p>

<p>"I wish to talk with her about my mother and father,
whom she once knew," said Kenneth. "But she refuses
to listen or to speak."</p>

<p>"Has my friend heap money?"</p>

<p>"I have some. Will money open her lips?"</p>

<p>The Indian gave an expressive grunt, then went on
to tell of Lyttleton's visit to their camp and interview
with the woman, of which he had been an unnoticed
witness.</p>

<p>He had not heard or understood all the talk between
them, but enough to enable him to gather by the assistance
of their tones and gestures, the holding up of the
purse, and the eager hand outstretched to receive it, that
a bribe had been offered and accepted, and her conduct
of to-day, which also he had closely watched, had convinced
him that her promise had been to maintain silence
toward Kenneth, of whose intended visit Lyttleton must
have known.</p>

<p>Clendenin listened in great surprise. Who could it
have been? He did not know that he had an enemy in
the whole world, and this visit was entirely unexpected
even to himself.</p>

<p>But Little Horn's communication gave him fresh hope.
"Would he be his messenger to the white squaw," he
asked earnestly; "would he go to her and say that if she
would talk with the pale face, and answer his questions
as well as she could he would give her as much money
as the pale face visitor of the previous night had promised
her if she kept silence?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
The Indian accepted the commission, went at once
to the wigwam, Kenneth slowly following, passed in, and
a few moments after reappeared in company with the
woman.</p>

<p>A change had come over her face; it no longer wore
the stolid look Kenneth had seen upon it during their
earlier interview, the features were agitated and there
were traces of tears on the cheeks. His words had
recalled half forgotten scenes of bitter sorrow, terror and
despair.</p>

<p>"Speak! I listen," she said in the English tongue,
seating herself and motioning to him to do the same, then
burying her face in her hands.</p>

<p>He dropped upon the grass by her side and began at
once in low, quiet, almost mournful tones.</p>

<p>"Many years ago, before I was born, there stood
two log cabins, some half mile apart, in a little valley
among the mountains of Tennessee. A young couple
named Clark, with a family of several small children,
lived in one; the other was occupied by two couples
bearing the same family name, Clendenin; the men
were distantly related; one older by twenty years or
more than the other; he had married a widow with one
child, a daughter, and she had shortly after become the
wife of his younger kinsman."</p>

<p>Kenneth paused.</p>

<p>"Go on," said his hearer, in smothered tones.</p>

<p>Little Horn, with native delicacy, had withdrawn
and thrown himself upon the grass just out of earshot.</p>

<p>Kenneth went on.</p>

<p>"These two families were the sole residents of the
little valley; the nearest white neighbor lived miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
away on the other side of the mountains, and between
lay forests filled with wild beasts and hostile Indians.</p>

<p>"One lovely summer day Mr. Clark was helping his
neighbors in the field, his wife visiting theirs. She had
taken her children with her and they were at play in the
door-yard.</p>

<p>"In the course of the day both mother and daughter
were taken sick, and two babes were born within half an
hour of each other.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clark had her hands more than full in attending
upon the women, and the children, both boys, hastily
wrapped in a blanket and laid in the same cradle, had
received no further attention, when a scream from her
own little ones, 'Mother, mother! the Injuns! the
Injuns!' sent her flying to their rescue."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," sobbed his listener. "Oh, my darlings,
tomahawked and scalped before my very eyes! I see
their bleeding corpses now! Their father's too, shot
down as he came running from the field to try to save us.
And then I was dragged away never to see home or relations
again!"</p>

<p>"Then you are indeed Reumah Clark?"</p>

<p>Kenneth's voice trembled with agitation as he asked
the question.</p>

<p>She bowed assent, her face still hidden in her hands.
But suddenly dropping them she gazed eagerly, searchingly,
into his face.</p>

<p>"And you, you who look so like the dead, who are
you?"</p>

<p>"One of those babes born on that terrible day," he
answered with emotion; "which, I do not know; and that
is what I have hoped even against hope, that you could
tell me. You laid us down together, you remember, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
to this day the question remains unsolved which was the
uncle and which the nephew. Did you observe any mark
upon either, anything at all to distinguish him from the
other?"</p>

<p>Clendenin was greatly agitated as he put this question,
and his breathing was almost suspended as he waited for
the reply.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "one had a very peculiar mark on
his breast. I was sort o' expecting it, and looked for it
right away."</p>

<p>"What was it, and on which child?" he asked with
the tone and manner of one to whom the answer must
bring life or death.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said, "let me tell it in my own way.
Clark he'd been a cabin boy aboard a ship, and an old
sailor had tattooed an anchor on his arm. 'Twas fur up
above his elbow, and didn't show except he took pains to
roll his sleeve up a-purpose."</p>

<p>She spoke hesitatingly, as one who had half forgotten
the use of her mother tongue, and to Clendenin the suspense
was agony well nigh unendurable; but by a strong
effort he kept himself quiet.</p>

<p>"Well," she continued, "the oldest Mrs. Clendenin
was over to our house not a week afore that awful day,
and Clark he showed her that mark on to his arm, and I
saw that she turned kind o' sick and faint at the sight,
and then quick as thought she slipped her hand into the
bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>"Clark, he'd turned away with a laugh, and gone
out o' the door; and I asked her what she did that
for, and she said she was afraid her child would be
marked, and if 'twas to be she wanted it where it wouldn't
show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
"Then she got up to go home, and says she, 'We'll
not speak of this, Reumah, and I'll try not to think of
it, so there'll be less likelihood of mischief coming of it.'"</p>

<p>"And it was her child, the older woman's?" cried
Kenneth, breathlessly; "and is this what you speak
of?" tearing open his shirt bosom as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it, as sure as I'm a living woman!" she
answered, gazing curiously at the deep red mark in the
form of an anchor on the left breast. "And now you
know which o' the two you are."</p>

<p>He drew a long, sighing breath of relief, as one who
feels a heavy weight fall from his shoulders, clasped his
hands, and lifted his eyes to heaven, his face radiant
with unutterable joy and thankfulness, his lips moving,
though no sound came from them.</p>

<p>She watched him in wonder and amazement.</p>

<p>"What's the difference," she asked, as he resumed
his former attitude, "and how comes it that your mother
didn't know by that very mark that you were hers?"</p>

<p>"She died within the hour," he said with emotion;
"raising herself in the bed, and looking through the open
door, she saw her husband slain, his reeking scalp held
aloft by a savage, and with a wild scream she fell back
and expired."</p>

<p>"And the rest?"</p>

<p>"The younger Clendenin gained the house barely in
time to secure the door before the Indians reached it,
and keeping up a vigorous fire through a chink in the
wall, his wife, ill as she was, loading for him, there
happening to be two guns in the house, he at length
succeeded in driving off the enemy.</p>

<p>"A few weeks later they left forever the scene of the
terrible tragedy, taking the two babes with them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
The interview lasted some time longer, Kenneth
expressing his gratitude to the woman with much warmth
and earnestness, and urging her to return to civilized
life.</p>

<p>This she steadily declined to do, saying that she did
not know of a living relative among the whites, had an
Indian husband, children and grandchildren, and had
learned to like her wild life.</p>

<p>Hearing that, he ceased his importunity, gave her all
the money he had with him and a written promise of
more, tearing a leaf from his note book for the purpose;
then with a cordial shake of the hand, and an invitation
to visit him the next day in Chillicothe, that he might
redeem his promise, bade her good-bye.</p>

<p>As he turned to go Little Horn rose from the grass and
came toward him, asking of his success.</p>

<p>In reply Kenneth told him he had learned all he
wished to know from the white squaw, and was greatly
indebted to him for his timely assistance.</p>

<p>He would have added a reward, but the lad utterly
refused to accept it, saying it was very little he had done
in return for what he owed to the saviour of his life. And
then he added that his influence with the white squaw
was due to the fact that he was her son, and that he
had informed her of the great service Kenneth had done
him years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxv" id="chapter_xxv">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Never since early boyhood had Clendenin borne
in his bosom so light and glad a heart as that with which
he left Old Town upon the close of his interview with
Reumah Clark.</p>

<p>One thought&mdash;that there was now no barrier between
him and his sweet and beautiful Nell, unless indeed, she
herself had created one, filled him with a joy and thankfulness
beyond the power of words to express.</p>

<p>But an enemy lay in wait to rob him of it.</p>

<p>Lyttleton, closely watching Clendenin, had noticed that
he tarried behind in the Indian camp while others were
leaving it; but carefully abstaining from any allusion to
the fact, he conducted the young lady whose escort he
was to her home, then leaving the town by the opposite
side, made a circuit through the woods that brought him
back to a hill overlooking the trail to Old Town, ascending
which he waited and watched for Kenneth's return.</p>

<p>Very impatient he grew toward the last, but not to be
baulked of his prey by hunger or weariness, he remained
at his post of observation until his eyes were gladdened
by the sight of the manly form of Clendenin mounted
on his gallant steed and following the trail at a brisk
canter that was bringing him rapidly nearer.</p>

<p>Lyttleton now hastily descended the hill, galloped
across a bit of prairie and struck into the trail just in
time to meet the man whom he cordially hated in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
heart while in outward seeming he was the warmest
friend.</p>

<p>"So here you are at last, doctor," he said with a genial
smile, "I declare I was actually growing uneasy about
you."</p>

<p>"How so?" returned Kenneth in surprise, "it is nothing
unusual for me to be out scouring the country at
any or all hours of the day and night."</p>

<p>"Yes, but among the savages you know. I saw that
you lingered behind as the rest of us set out on our
return to the town, and I thought it not at all impossible
that the wild creatures might be moved to do you a
mischief."</p>

<p>He looked keenly at Kenneth as he spoke, thinking
to read in his countenance how his errand had sped.
He had never seen it half so bright and joyous.</p>

<p>"Ah, he has won," he said to himself with a pang of
mingled disappointment and envy. "He has learned all,
and it is in his favor. Curse him, he shan't have her too
if I can prevent it!</p>

<p>"You seem to have had a pleasant time," he said
aloud, "I think I never saw you look quite so cheery."</p>

<p>Kenneth only smiled, he felt so free and happy, as
light and joyous as a bird on the wing.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on your good luck, whatever it
may have been," continued Lyttleton, still eyeing him
curiously; "and I must ask a return in kind from you,
for I too have been made a happy, yes, the very happiest
of men to-day."</p>

<p>Clendenin turned upon him a startled, questioning
look, his very lips growing white; he tried to speak, but
could not find his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lyttleton went on with a cruel delight in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
pain he saw he was giving; "I am sure you will think
so when I tell you that Miss Lamar is my promised wife
and I shall soon be the husband of the finest woman in
America."</p>

<p>Kenneth answered not a word, the blow was so sudden,
so terrible, so stunning; for it never occurred to
him that those words which sounded the death knell of
his fondest hopes were a falsehood, and, ah! he had
thought it impossible that Nell could ever give herself
to one so utterly devoid of noble qualities as this stranger
who was now boasting of having won her.</p>

<p>Lyttleton perceived with savage exultation how he
had wrung the heart of the man whom he hated;&mdash;hated
all the more bitterly because he owed him his life
and because of his own ill-desert as a trifler with sweet
Marian's affections: whose sworn foe he was even before
leaving England for America; his very errand to this
country being one of wrong to him, an errand which
he now foresaw was likely to miscarry through the
information gleaned from the white squaw of the Shawnee
brave.</p>

<p>They were passing a farm-house; some one standing at
its gate hailed the doctor, and with a slight parting
inclination of the head to Lyttleton, Kenneth turned
aside and obeyed the call.</p>

<p>The sun was touching the top of the hill which bounds
Chillicothe on the west, as he resumed his homeward way,
a different man from the one who had left Old Town
so full of joy and glad anticipation; the very dropping of
his figure, as he moved slowly along with the bridle lying
loosely upon Romeo's neck, spoke of utter dejection.</p>

<p>What was life worth without his love, his darling?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Oh, why had not this knowledge come to him a little
sooner, this that unsealed his lips. Why had he not
yielded to his impulse that stormy night as they stood
alone together by the fire, and poured out the story of his
love? How much wiser and kinder to have done it,
even though he had to tell her, too, that an impassable
barrier stood between them!</p>

<p>He could see it so plainly now, but then, his eyes
were blinded.</p>

<p>And she, how could he blame her if her love had
at last turned to aversion and she had given herself to
another?</p>

<p>But alas, alas, how ill she had chosen, a man devoid of
principle and utterly selfish; for so far had Kenneth
succeeded in reading Lyttleton's true character.</p>

<p>But these were vain regrets; he must school himself
to bear bravely his grief and disappointment; trouble
did not spring out of the ground, and the loving
Father above never sent to His children one unneeded
pang.</p>

<p>And was life indeed all dark to him? Was it nothing
that a terrible dread had been taken away? That he
had reason, intellect, education, health and strength,
that God had given him skill to relieve pain and suffering?</p>

<p>Ah, his mercies were far beyond his deserts, and life
could not be a desolate waste while power was granted
him to minister to the comfort and happiness of others;
and while there remained to him, not only the love of
the two dear ones at Glen Forest, but also the sweeter,
dearer love of Him who saith to His children:</p>

<p>"Lo, I am with you always even unto the end of the
world." "I have loved thee with an everlasting love."
"I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
The precious comforting words came to him almost as
if spoken by an audible voice, and were as balm and
healing to his wounded spirit.</p>

<p>There were business matters claiming his immediate
attention, and he now resolutely turned his thoughts
upon them.</p>

<p>He decided upon an early visit to his old home; he
must see her whom he had always called mother, but
who, as he had learned from Reumah Clark, was in
reality his sister; sweet Marian, too. Ah, she must never
know that he was less nearly related to her than she
fondly believed. It would but give her unnecessary
pain.</p>

<p>But first of all steps should be taken to get Reumah
Clark's evidence in a form that would make it available
legal proof of his identity, for there was much dependent
upon that.</p>

<p>On reaching the town he at once sought Godfrey
Dale, and they were closeted together for an hour or
more.</p>

<p>In this interview Dale learned what had been his friend's
secret grief, that it had in a measure passed away with
the knowledge of his true parentage, though it was
sorrow of heart to him that it proved the tie of kinship
with the dear ones at home less close than he had once
believed, and the importance, for certain grave reasons,
of his being able to bring forward indisputable proof of
his identity.</p>

<p>Dale understood the management of the business;
the first step in which was to get the woman into the
town and have her deposition taken before a magistrate.</p>

<p>It was probable that she would come in the next morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
of her own accord, in order to receive the money for
which she held Clendenin's note; if she did not Dale was
to go in search of her.</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped that secret foe of yours will not get
hold of her again in the meantime," he remarked. "Who
can he be? I know of no one who has cause for enmity
toward you, unless, indeed, as a rival in the good graces
of a certain fair damsel," he added jocosely, "and, why
Kenneth, man, that would be Lyttleton! And he's
mean enough to serve you such a scurvy trick, too. But
then, on second thought, how would he know anything
about the woman or your interest in her? No; I confess
I am nonplussed."</p>

<p>"Beside," said Kenneth sadly, "he tells me he is a
successful rival, so he might well afford to refrain
from any interference with my welfare."</p>

<p>"He successful with Miss Nell?" cried Dale with
scornful incredulity. "Don't you believe it! And yet,"
with a sudden change of tone, "women are strange,
unaccountable creatures, and it is possible her seeming
contempt and dislike were only assumed to hide her
real feelings. Heighho! I really thought your chances
better than mine; those last by no means so poor as
Lyttleton's."</p>

<p>A party of the merchants of the town were to start
three days from this time for the East, to buy goods.
Their custom was to go in companies, as, a great portion
of the country being still in wild state, much of it was
covered with immense forests, containing but a few widely
scattered dwellings. They must, perforce, carry a
good deal of money with them and it was unsafe for one
to travel alone.</p>

<p>Kenneth had announced his intention to join this party,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
but that evening's mail brought a letter from Glen
Forest which so filled him with anxiety and alarm, made
his presence at home so urgently necessary, that he at
once decided to risk going with no companion but Zeb,
and to set off at dawn of the coming day, leaving to
Dale the whole care and responsibility of getting Reumah
Clark's evidence into proper shape.</p>

<p>Dale used every argument and persuasion to induce
his friend to wait for company; two days he thought
would make so little difference, and the risk to a solitary
traveller was so great; but all to no purpose; Clendenin
would hardly stay to hear him out, there was so much
to be attended to in the few hours that remained before
he should leave for an absence that might extend
to months.</p>

<p>Several patients must be visited and recommended to
the charge of a brother physician, some purchases
made, and some friends called upon for a word of farewell.</p>

<p>It would seem a strange, unkind, ungrateful thing to
go without saying good-bye to Major Lamar and his family,
who had always made him so entirely one of themselves.</p>

<p>And Nell? Ah, he could not, would not go away without
learning from her own lips if Lyttleton's story were
true.</p>

<p>And if it were not? But ah, he dare not think any
further.</p>

<p>His heart beat almost audibly as he opened the gate
and hurried up the path to the house.</p>

<p>The bright moonlight showed him the major sitting
alone in the porch.</p>

<p>"Ah, good evening, doctor," he said, rising to shake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
hands and set a chair for his guest. "I am especially
glad to see you to-night, as I am just in the mood for a
friendly chat."</p>

<p>"Thank you, major, but I am in unusual haste," Kenneth
answered. "Can I see the ladies?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to say I cannot give you that pleasure to-night,
doctor," was the laughing reply. "Mrs. Lamar has
gone to bed tired out with the exertion and excitement
of the day, and Nell is not at home; won't be for a week
or two, at least; has gone home with a friend living
fifteen miles from town."</p>

<p>Kenneth almost staggered under the blow. Then a
wild impulse seized him to follow her and know his fate
from her own mouth, though it would delay his journey
for one day, if not for two. But recalling some words of
the letter just received, words that made him feel that
every moment's delay on his part was hazardous to sweet
Marian, he put it from him with heroic self-denial,
briefly explained his errand, parried some remonstrances
such as Dale had already wasted upon him, and with a
cordial parting shake of the hand and a farewell message
for the family, turned and went away.</p>

<p>Lyttleton's heart that afternoon was like a cage of
unclean birds full of malice, envy, anger and hate. Kenneth
having left him in answer to the summons to the
farm-house, he pursued his way to the town muttering
imprecations upon the head of his late companion and
mentally resolving schemes for his injury.</p>

<p>"Curse him!" he said again, "is he to have all and I
none? Would that fate were but kind enough to remove
him out of my path!"</p>

<p>"Do it yourself!"</p>

<p>It seemed an almost audible suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
He started and glanced around with a shudder, half
expecting to see the tempter.</p>

<p>"No, no, I am not so bad as that!" he answered
aloud. "I could never stain my hands with blood, but
if the Indians should slay him in the woods, as they did
Capt. Herrod, or if his horse should happen to stumble
and he fall and break his neck, well, it would not grieve
me very deeply, ha, ha!</p>

<p>"I suppose the girl wouldn't have me even then," he
continued with a gloomy scowl, "but I'd have undisturbed
possession of&mdash;But nonsense! I must deal with
things as they are."</p>

<p>He continued his cogitations, but had not yet succeeded
in arranging any definite plan when he arrived at
his lodgings and dismounted, giving his horse in charge
to Hans.</p>

<p>However, the knowledge casually gained in the course
of the evening, of Kenneth's intended departure early
the next morning for the East, and with no companion
but his negro servant, brought a sudden suggestion
to his mind which filled him with fiendish
delight.</p>

<p>A letter from England, like Clendenin's received by
that evening's mail, furnished a plausible pretext.</p>

<p>Hans was summoned and given orders to make everything
ready to leave Chillicothe at once.</p>

<p>"Dish night, mynheer?" queried the man in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, this night; there is a moon and we can travel by
her light. I have news from England and must return
thither with all speed."</p>

<p>"De horses pe not shtrong enough to go day and
night, mynheer," remarked Hans, scratching his head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
and looking not over pleased; for he was loth to lose
his night's rest.</p>

<p>"That's my affair; you have nothing to do but obey
orders," was the haughty rejoinder.</p>

<p>Lyttleton knew that Nell was out of town, and now
was glad that it had so happened, as he did not care to
meet her again, yet felt that it would not look well for
him to leave the place without a parting call on the
family.</p>

<p>He met Clendenin coming away, passed him with a
cold bow, and joined the major who was still on the
porch, its sole occupant as before.</p>

<p>"What you, too, sir?" he exclaimed, when Lyttleton
had explained the object of his call. "The doctor was
in but now to say that he leaves unexpectedly in the
early morning; but it seems that you are making even
greater haste to forsake us. Coming back again, I hope."</p>

<p>"Doubtful, my good sir, and I must leave my adieu
to the ladies with you, regretting deeply that I could
not deliver them in person," Lyttleton said, lying with a
glibness that was the result of long practice.</p>

<p>He tarried but a few moments, and again the major
was left to his solitary meditations, which now ran upon
the question whether Nell had aught to do with the sudden
migration of these two admirers of hers. He could not
tell, for the girl had kept her own council in regard to
her feelings toward them, and Lyttleton's offer of the
previous day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxvi" id="chapter_xxvi">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Dale was in his office, very busy with some writing,
when Lyttleton looked in.</p>

<p>"Excuse the interruption, Mr. Dale," he said, holding
out his hand, "but I did not like to go without saying
good-bye to you and the doctor. He, however, I find is
not in."</p>

<p>"Good-bye! you're not going to leave Chillicothe
to-night, are you?" cried Godfrey in surprise, as he laid
down his pen and took the offered hand.</p>

<p>"Yes; immediately, Hans has everything packed,
and the horses saddled and at the door. Had a letter
from home to-night, and find I must tarry no longer.
Please give my respects and adieus to the doctor," he
added, as he hurried away.</p>

<p>"I wonder he's not afraid to risk travelling with only
that rascally looking servant, who might rob and kill him
and nobody any the wiser," thought Dale. "Well," he
remarked aloud, resuming his pen, "I suppose it's no
affair of mine."</p>

<p>Was it a haunting doubt of Hans's fidelity or some
other motive that led Lyttleton to turn to him, as they
left the town, and bid him ride by his side instead of
behind him?</p>

<p>However that may have been, he kept a sharp watch
upon his valet's movements.</p>

<p>Presently he took him into his confidence in some
degree, partially unfolding a plot to get Clendenin into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
his power, and securing the Hessian's co-operation by
the promise of a bribe.</p>

<p>They pressed forward all that night and the next day,
pausing only for a short rest when their horses showed
signs of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The greater part of the way was very lonely; they
had met no one since early morning, when toward the
close of the day they overtook a man mounted on a
sorry nag and jogging along in silence and solitude; a
villainous looking fellow, in whom Lyttleton at once
recognized one of his intended tools; whose acquaintance
he had made on the outward bound journey of
some months ago, and whom he had casually discovered
to be an enemy to Dr. Clendenin.</p>

<p>It was in fact Brannon, who had never forgotten or
forgiven the part Kenneth had had in his conviction of
the theft of the great-coat, handkerchief, and shirt,
abstracted from the dwelling of the Barbours.</p>

<p>Lyttleton hailed him with, "Hello, Brannon, you're
the very man I was wanting to see."</p>

<p>"And who may you be?" returned the fellow surlily,
showing a scowling face as he glanced back over his
shoulder at the speaker; then suddenly wheeling his
horse across the narrow path so as to bar their further
progress, "What do you want with me?" he demanded
in a tone of one who feels himself at enmity with his
kind.</p>

<p>"To furnish you with a bit of employment very much
to your taste," answered Lyttleton.</p>

<p>"And what may that be? Ha, I remember you now,
the English gent that was a goin' out to Chillicothe some
months back, and had so many questions to ask about
Dr. Clendenin. Curse him! Well, did ye find it all out?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
"It?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it, whatever you wanted to know."</p>

<p>"Yes; I found out, what I suspected before, that
he is very much in my way: and&mdash;but before I lay my
plans open to you I must have your promise, your oath
of secrecy."</p>

<p>"Them's easy given," the fellow answered with an
unpleasant laugh; "I promise and swear never to tell
no tales consarnin' what you're agoin' to say."</p>

<p>"Very well. Clendenin is travelling in this direction,
with no companion but a young negro servant who, I
take it, is neither very brave nor strong."</p>

<p>A malicious gleam of satisfaction shone in Brannon's
eyes.</p>

<p>Lyttleton noted it with pleasure.</p>

<p>"We could not have a better opportunity," he went
on; "you who have an old score against him, and I
who find him as I just said entirely too much in my
way."</p>

<p>"What are you at, mister, out with it plump and
plain," Brannon said with an impatient gesture and a
volley of oaths, as Lyttleton came to a pause and looked
hesitatingly at him. "I ain't no fancy for this 'ere beating
about the bush. Is it his life you want, or not?"</p>

<p>"No, no; I'm no murderer!" Lyttleton exclaimed
with a shudder and a fearful glance from side to side.
"But patience, man, and I'll explain in a few words.
We'll call this doctor a mad fellow, perhaps it isn't so
very far from the truth, ha, ha, and we'll take him
prisoner, and keep him such somewhere in these woods
until I can make arrangements to remove him to a mad
house."</p>

<p>Brannon listened with a grim smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
"But look ye here, stranger," he interrupted, "what if
he should get free and peach on us?"</p>

<p>"We must take care that he doesn't; and I'll make it
worth your while to take the risk. Can you get help in
capturing him?"</p>

<p>Brannon nodded. "Here comes one now that'll bear
a hand willingly if you give him his price;" and as he
spoke he waved his hand toward a tall, burly figure just
emerging from the wood a few paces from them.</p>

<p>"Dree of us," muttered Hans, watching its approach;
"dat ish pooty goot; and mynheer, too; dree, four
against two. We takes dem brisoner mitout fail."</p>

<p>The last comer was drawing near with long and rapid
strides.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked sharply and bringing his
rifle to his shoulder. "Ah, is it you, Jack! what's
up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me, Bill Shark," answered Brannon. "Come
on; here's a gent as has a job suited to the likes of us."</p>

<p>As the fellow came near enough for a distinct view of
his features, Lyttleton involuntarily shrank from him,
so brutal and forbidding was their expression.</p>

<p>But recovering himself instantly, he repeated substantially,
and under the same promise of secrecy, what he
had been saying to Brannon.</p>

<p>"I'm your man, if we can agree on the terms," was
the rejoinder. "I'll want a pretty stiff price, mind ye,
stranger, for it's like to be a risky business, more so than
if ye wanted him put clean out o' the way; for 'dead men
tell no tales,' you know."</p>

<p>Lyttleton shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, no, I can't stain my hands with blood, his or
that of any other man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
The ruffian regarded him with a brutal sneer and a
muttered sentence, of which the only audible words
were "white livered coward."</p>

<p>Lyttleton writhed under the charge but dared not
resent it. In fact he began to feel himself in a perilous
position; darkness was already settling down over the
forest, he had not full confidence in his valet, and these
others were evidently unscrupulous scoundrels.</p>

<p>"How much ahead are you, did ye say?" queried
Shark.</p>

<p>"I think we have the start of him by from six to eight
hours," replied Lyttleton. "Besides, we have pushed
on more rapidly than he would be likely to, as you
may judge by the condition of our horses."</p>

<p>"H'm! then he'll most likely be along here about this
time, or a trifle earlier, to-morrow, stop fur his lodging
at Brannon's, just above here, a little back in the woods,
or at my shanty five miles furder on. 'Twont make
much difference; whichever he stops with, the other'll
help entertain him. And, stranger, we kin turn out
purty strong on occasion. I've two strappin' sons and a
nevvy, and the old woman can lend a helpin' hand too,
when she's wanted.</p>

<p>"S'posen' you and Brannon and this other feller come
over home with me now, and let's talk it over. We'll
determine just what's to be done, and I'll set my price."</p>

<p>Lyttleton had felt a cold chill running down his spine
during this speech and at the moment would gladly have
put many miles between him and what he began to suspect
was an organized band of robbers and cut-throats.</p>

<p>But evidently it would not do to show fear. Carefully
steadying his voice, he courteously thanked Shark for his
invitation, but declined it on the plea that they all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
himself, Hans and both their horses, were in sore need of
rest; for which reason they would stop for the night
with Brannon; his house being so much nearer. This
seemed satisfactory and thither they all went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxvii" id="chapter_xxvii">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>The sun had not yet risen, and few of the townspeople
were astir, when Kenneth and his faithful Zeb set
forth upon their journey.</p>

<p>They rode slowly through the almost deserted streets,
the master in seemingly absent mood, quiet and thoughtful
even to sadness, the servant glancing briskly from
side to side with a nod and grin for each visible acquaintance
with whom he felt himself upon terms of something
like equality.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Tig; dis heyah niggah's off for Glen
Forest," he shouted as they passed the major's.</p>

<p>Tig, who was cutting wood in the kitchen door-yard,
dropped his axe to gaze after them in wondering incredulity.</p>

<p>"Oh, you go 'long wid yo' tomfoolin'," he muttered,
as he stooped to pick it up again, "'taint no sech ting;
and the doctah ain't never goin' so fur, 'tout sayin'
good-bye to our folks; and Miss Nell she's away whar he
can't git at her. 'Spect I knows who's powerful fond of
her, and who tinks he's mighty sight nicer'n any ole
Britisher."</p>

<p>They were early risers at the major's, and Mrs. Lamar
having retired the previous night several hours before
her usual time, had slept off her fatigue and found herself
ready to begin the day earlier than was her wont.</p>

<p>From her chamber window she, too, saw Kenneth and
his attendant ride by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
"Why, there goes Dr. Clendenin equipped as for
a journey, valise, saddle-bags and servant!" she exclaimed,
addressing her husband who was still in bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's off for Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>"For Pennsylvania, it's very sudden, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he had bad news last night, sickness in the
family I believe, that hurried him off in great haste.
He called to bid us good-bye, but found no one but
me.</p>

<p>"But you will be more surprised to hear that Lyttleton
left town last night in obedience to a summons from
England. He, too, called and left his adieus for you
and Nell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamar faced round upon the major a face full of
astonishment, not wholly unmixed with disappointment
and vexation.</p>

<p>"Gone!" she cried, "actually gone for good! I must
say, Percy, that I am completely out of patience with
Nell."</p>

<p>"With Nell, pray what has she to do with it?"</p>

<p>"She has rejected him. I suspected it before; now I
am sure of it. News from England indeed!" and she
turned away with a contemptuous sniff.</p>

<p>"Possibly you are correct in your conjecture," the
major remarked, recovering from the surprise her words
had given him; "but if she has rejected Lyttleton, she
had a perfect right to do so, and I am inclined neither
to blame her nor to regret her action."</p>

<p>"Why it would have been a splendid match, Percy,
and such a chance as she is not likely to see again."</p>

<p>"Not in my opinion. He seems to be wealthy, but I do
not admire his character. And it would have robbed me
of my little sister, taking her so far away that I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
hardly hope to see her again in this world. I should far
rather see her the wife of Clendenin."</p>

<p>"I gave that up long ago," returned his wife in an
impatient tone, as she hastily left the room.</p>

<p>"I believe something has gone wrong between them;
I wonder what it can be," soliloquized the major while
making his toilet, and at the same time taking a mental
retrospect of such of the interviews of Nell and Dr.
Clendenin as had come under his notice.</p>

<p>But having no proclivity for match-making, and no
desire to be relieved of the support of his young sister,
whose presence in his family he greatly enjoyed, he
shortly dismissed the subject from his thoughts.</p>

<p>Not so with Kenneth; as he passed the house he
involuntarily glanced toward the window of her room,
half expecting to catch a glimpse of the face dearest and
loveliest to him of all on earth, then turned away with an
inward sigh, remembering sadly that each step forward
was taking him farther away from her.</p>

<p>Very much cast down he was for a time, having had in
Hans's story to Zeb, that his master was but going away
temporarily for the purpose of making suitable preparations
for his approaching nuptials, what seemed confirmation
strong of the truth of Lyttleton's assertion that
he was Nell's accepted suitor. But ere long he was able
to stay himself upon his God, and casting all care for
himself, and those dearer than self, upon that almighty
Friend, resumed his accustomed cheerfulness and presently
woke the echoes of the forest with a song of
praise; Zeb, riding a few paces behind, joining in with a
hearty goodwill.</p>

<p>They had left Chillicothe far in the rear and the nearest
human habitation was miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
They made a long day's journey and bivouacked that
night under a clump of trees on the edge of a prairie,
and beside a little stream of clear dancing water.</p>

<p>It was Clendenin's intention to be early in the saddle
again, and great was his disappointment on the following
morning to find Romeo so lame that a day's rest just
where they were was an imperative necessity.</p>

<p>It was a strange and perplexing dispensation of Providence;
yet recognizing it as such, he resolutely put aside
the first feeling of impatience as he remembered how
sorely he was needed at Glen Forest; how the dear ones
would be looking and longing for his coming. There
must be some good reason for this apparently unfortunate
detention, so he submitted to it with resignation and
passed the day not unpleasantly or unprofitably in reading;
it was his habit to carry a pocket volume with him
while travelling, or wandering through the adjacent
wood.</p>

<p>They were able to move on the next day, but only
slowly, as the horse had not fully recovered; and while
halting for an hour's rest at noon, they were, to their
great delight, overtaken by the other party from Chillicothe.</p>

<p>It consisted of three merchants, Messrs. Grey, Collins
and Jones, and a stalwart backwoodsman and hunter,
Tom Johnson by name.</p>

<p>They also were much pleased at the meeting,
which they had desired but hardly hoped for, though
they had set out a day earlier than had been expected,
the merchants hastening their preparations when they
found that by so doing they would secure the company
of the hunter, who for fearlessness, strength, and skill
in the use of fire-arms, was a host in himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Each merchant carried his money in his saddle-bags,
and the whole party were well armed.</p>

<p>Greeting Clendenin with a glad, "Hello!" they hastily
dismounted, secured their horses, and joined him, producing
from their saddle-bags such store of choice provisions
as made Zeb's eyes dance with delight, for the
lad was in his way quite an epicure.</p>

<p>The sight of the goodly array of weapons of defence,
and stout arms to wield them, gave him scarcely less
pleasure, for Zeb's courage was not always at fever
heat.</p>

<p>"Golly, massa doctah!" he exclaimed, showing a
double row of white and even teeth, "I 'spec's we
needn't be 'fraid no robbahs now. Gib um jessie ef
dey comes roun' us."</p>

<p>"Best not to be too jubilant, Zeb," said his master;
"you and I may have to fall behind because of Romeo's
lameness."</p>

<p>"No, no, never fear," said the others, "we are not
going to forsake you, doc, now that we have joined company."</p>

<p>They did not linger long over their meal and were soon
in the saddle again, riding sometimes two abreast, at
others in single file, but always near enough for exchange
of talk.</p>

<p>Kenneth bore his own burden bravely, was quite his
usual cheerful, genial self, and no one suspected what a
load of sorrow and anxiety was pressing upon him.</p>

<p>They journeyed on without mishap or adventure, and
late in the afternoon came to a two story log dwelling
standing a little back from the road, or rather trail, for it
was nothing more.</p>

<p>There was nothing attractive about the aspect of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
house or its surroundings, but the sun was near his setting,
the next human habitation was in all probability ten
or fifteen miles further on, and the way to it lay through
a dense forest where, doubtless, panthers, bears and
wolves abounded.</p>

<p>A moment's consultation led to the decision that they
would pass the night here if they could get lodging in
the house.</p>

<p>An elderly woman of slatternly appearance, hair
unkempt, clothing torn and soiled, had come to the
door.</p>

<p>"What's wanted?" she asked in a harsh voice.</p>

<p>"Shelter for the night for men and beasts," returned
Clendenin, who had been unanimously chosen leader of
the party.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno 'bout it, I haven't no man about, but
if ye'll 'tend to yer beasts yerselves, yer can stay."</p>

<p>They agreed to the conditions. She pointed out the
stable, and they led their horses thither, curried and fed
them, remarking to each other, meanwhile, that they did
not like the woman's looks; she had a bad countenance.</p>

<p>She had gone back into the house, and as she moved
here and there about her work, muttered discontentedly
to herself,</p>

<p>"There's too many o' 'em. Bill, he won't like it. But
I wonder if the right one's among 'em. Wish I
knowed."</p>

<p>Hearing their voices outside again, she stepped to the
door.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be a wantin' supper, won't ye?"</p>

<p>"Yes, let us have it as soon as you can, for we're tired
and hungry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
"She mout put some pizen in de wittles, massa doctah,
don't you tink?" whispered Zeb, close at Kenneth's
ear, and shuddering as he spoke.</p>

<p>"If you think so, it might be as well to watch her,"
was the quiet half-amused answer.</p>

<p>"Dat I will, sah!" and Zeb bustled in and sat himself
down between the table and the wide chimney, where he
could have a full view of all the preparations for the
coming meal.</p>

<p>The woman scowled at him and broadly hinted that he
was in the way, but Zeb was obtuse and would not take
a hint.</p>

<p>He watched her narrowly as she mixed corn-bread and
put it to bake, as she made the rye coffee, and fried the
ham and eggs. It would have been impossible for her to
put a single ingredient into any of these without his
knowledge.</p>

<p>Nor did he relax his scrutiny until he had eaten his
own supper, after seeing the gentlemen safely through
theirs.</p>

<p>"She mout put sumpin into de cups wen she pours
de coffee," he had said to himself.</p>

<p>It did not escape him that she listened with a sort of
concealed eagerness to every word that was said by her
guests, and that she started slightly and looked earnestly
at Dr. Clendenin the first time he was addressed by name
in her hearing.</p>

<p>"What shall we call you, mother?" asked the hunter,
lighting his pipe at her fire for an after supper smoke.</p>

<p>"'Taint perticlar, ye can just call me that, if ye like,"
she returned dryly.</p>

<p>"You don't live here alone," he remarked, glancing at
a coat hanging on the wall. "Where's your man now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
"Off a huntin'. Where's your woman?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, hain't found her yet," he laughed, taking
the pipe between his lips and sauntering to the door, outside
of which his companions were grouped.</p>

<p>The air there was slightly damp and chill, but far
preferable to that within, which reeked with a mixture of
smells of stale tobacco, garlic, boiled cabbage and filth
combined.</p>

<p>It was growing dark.</p>

<p>The woman lighted a candle and set it on the table, muttering
half aloud, as Zeb rose and pushed back his chair:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're done at last."</p>

<p>Then she bustled about putting the food away and
washing her dishes.</p>

<p>Johnson finished his pipe and proposed retiring to bed,
as they wanted to make an early start in the morning.</p>

<p>A general assent was given and the woman was asked
to show them where they were to sleep.</p>

<p>She vouchsafed no answer in words, but taking from
the mantel a saucer filled with grease, in which a bit of
rag was floating, she set it on the table, lighted one end
of the rag, picked up the candle, and motioning them to
follow her, ascended a step-ladder to the story above; letting
fall drops of melted tallow here and there as she went.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the ladder, they found themselves
in an outer room that had the appearance of being used
as a depository for every sort of rubbish.</p>

<p>Crossing this, their conductress opened a door leading
into a smaller apartment, communicating, by an inner
door, with still another.</p>

<p>There was a bed in each and a few other articles of
furniture, all of the roughest kind. Dirty and untidy in
the extreme, the rooms were by no means inviting to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
travellers, but it was Hobson's choice, and they found no
fault to the hostess.</p>

<p>"You white folks kin sleep in them two beds," she said,
with a wave of her hand toward first one and then the
other, "and the nigger, he kin lop down outside on them
horse blankets, if he likes."</p>

<p>And setting the candle down on top of a chest of
drawers, she stalked away without another word.</p>

<p>"Massa doctah, and all you gentlemens, please sahs,
lemme stay in heyah," pleaded Zeb in an undertone of
affright. "Dat woman she look at me down stairs 'sif
she like to stick dat carvin' knife right froo me."</p>

<p>No one answered at the moment; they were all sending
suspicious glances about the two rooms, and Zeb
quietly closed and secured the door.</p>

<p>"Ki! massas, jus' look a heyah!" he cried in an
excited whisper, and pointing with his finger.</p>

<p>"What is it?" they asked, turning to look.</p>

<p>Zeb sprang for the candle, and bringing it close showed
a small hole in the door.</p>

<p>"A bullet hole, sure as you live," exclaimed Grey, who
was nearest.</p>

<p>"And exactly opposite the bed," added Jones, stepping
to it and beginning to throw back the covers.</p>

<p>In an instant they were all at his side, and there was a
universal, half suppressed exclamation of horror and dismay,
as a hard straw mattress, much stained with blood,
was exposed to their view by the flickering light of the
candle, which Zeb in his intense excitement had nearly
dropped.</p>

<p>They looked at those tell-tale stains and then into each
other's faces. A trifle pale at first most of them were,
but calm and courageous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Clendenin was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"We have evidently fallen into a den of thieves and
murderers, but by the help of the Lord we shall escape
their snares."</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll trust in God, boys, and keep our powder
dry," said Grey.</p>

<p>"And Heaven send us a more peaceful end than some
poor wretch has found," added Collins, pointing with a
sympathetic sigh to the gory evidences.</p>

<p>"We must keep a sharp lookout, for we may depend
that thar hunter'll return to his wife's embraces afore
mornin'," remarked Johnson, grimly.</p>

<p>They at once set about making a thorough examination
of the rooms, but found nothing more to arouse
uneasiness, except the fact that the window of one opened
out upon the roof of a shed, by means of which it was
easily accessible from the ground.</p>

<p>Then their plans were quickly laid. They would all
occupy that one room, and take turns in watching, two
at a time; thus giving to each about two-thirds of the
night for rest and sleep.</p>

<p>The arms were examined and every man's weapon laid
close at his hand, ready for instant use.</p>

<p>These preparations completed, Grey turned to Kenneth,
saying softly:</p>

<p>"Doc, we seem pretty well able to defend ourselves in
case of attack, but it wouldn't hurt to ask help from a
higher Power."</p>

<p>"No," said Kenneth, kneeling down, the others doing
the same; then, in a few appropriate, low-breathed
words, he asked his Father to have them in his kind care
and keeping, and if it was His will grant them safety
without the shedding of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxviii" id="chapter_xxviii">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Down-stairs the woman was moving about her work,
stopping now and then for a moment to listen to the
sounds overhead.</p>

<p>"Why don't they get to bed and to sleep!" she muttered
at length with an oath. "Bill and the boys must
be sharp set for their supper and will come in most
ready to take my head off. 'Tain't no fault o' mine, but
that'll not make no difference. Well, I'll call 'em anyhow,
for them fellers ain't comin' down agin to-night."</p>

<p>So saying she set her light in the window and hurried
her culinary operations, for she was getting ready a
second and more plentiful meal than the one she had set
before the travellers.</p>

<p>Ere many moments four men, great broad-shouldered,
brawny, rough looking fellows, on whose faces ignorance,
vice and cruelty were plainly stamped, came creeping
stealthily in at the open door.</p>

<p>"Well, old girl, what have you bagged?" asked the
eldest, in whom we recognize Bill Shark, the confederate
of Brannon and Lyttleton. "I conclude it's somethin',
since we've been kept a starvin' till this time o' night."</p>

<p>His tone, though suppressed, was savage, and his look
angry and sullen.</p>

<p>She held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>"Hush-sh-sh! they're up and awake yit. More quiet,
boys. Let up now, and go to work. The vittles is all
on table."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
"Are ye a goin' to tell me what I asked?" demanded
her husband in a fierce undertone, as he sat down and
began helping himself liberally to the smoking viands,
but looking more at her than at them.</p>

<p>"It's him," she answered, with a slight chuckle; "and
he's as nice lookin' and soft spoken a chap as ever you
see."</p>

<p>"An' what o' that?" sneered one of the sons. "His
purty face ain't a goin' to save him."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, Abner; but I'm afeard they're too strong
fur ye."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Six, countin' the nigger, and one on 'em's Tom
Johnson."</p>

<p>This announcement was received with a volley of oaths
and curses, not loud but deep, Bill adding:</p>

<p>"He'll count two at least."</p>

<p>"The other two fellers'll have to come and lend a
hand whether or no," said Abner gloomily. "Don't
you let 'em off, dad. With them and Brannon we'll be
seven. And if we come on 'em asleep, why, we'll not
have such hard work, I take it."</p>

<p>"Time they were asleep now. How long since they
went up there?"</p>

<p>There was an angry gleam in Bill's eyes as he turned
them upon his wife.</p>

<p>"Long enough to have got to sleep twic't over, I
should think. But they hain't done it. Hark! they're
a movin' about, and talkin' too, I believe."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't mind my orders, and ought to be
licked."</p>

<p>A volley of oaths followed, and he half rose from his
chair and seized her by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
But his sons interfered.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, old man?" pulling him back into his
seat; "we'll not have a ghost of a chance if you kick up
a row now."</p>

<p>He yielded, though with an ill grace, and the woman,
not in the least disconcerted by his brutal behavior, said
in her ordinary tone, as she replenished his empty
cup:</p>

<p>"'Twasn't no fault o' mine, Bill; I'd a drugged 'em,
every one, if that nigger would a took his eyes off o' me
for a single moment; but it did beat all, the way he
watched me back and forad and all the time. I hadn't
the least mite of a chance."</p>

<p>This explanation seemed to appease the man's wrath,
and the meal was concluded without further disturbance.</p>

<p>A whispered consultation followed; then two of the
younger ruffians went out and plunged into the forest in
the direction from whence they had come.</p>

<p>At no very great distance they came out upon a little
clearing where stood a tiny cabin, roughly but strongly
built of unhewn logs, no window save an aperture scarce
a foot square near the roof, and the one door, of solid
oak planks, furnished with heavy bolts and bars upon the
outside.</p>

<p>This was the prison intended by Lyttleton for the safe
keeping of Clendenin, the man to whom he owed his
life.</p>

<p>Heretofore it had been used by the Sharks as a depository
for their ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>Near at hand, but concealed from view by the thick
undergrowth, the Englishman and his valet lay sleeping
upon the ground, wrapped each in his blanket, and with
sword and gun within reach of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
A few minutes' search disclosed their whereabouts to
the Sharks, and it was no gentle waking that ensued.</p>

<p>"Ho! rouse up, I tell ye, and wake your master!"
growled Abner, touching Hans with his foot. "You're
both wanted at the house."</p>

<p>"Yaas," grunted Hans, sleepily, "but I dinks you
petter leaves mynheer to dake his sleep."</p>

<p>"What is it? What's wanted this time of night?"
demanded Lyttleton, starting up and glancing about him
in no amiable mood.</p>

<p>"You're wanted," was the gruff, unceremonious reply.
"Game's bagged, but such a lot we must come on 'em
as strong as possible."</p>

<p>"What! you've got Clendenin?"</p>

<p>Lyttleton's tone was jubilant.</p>

<p>"Humph! he's there, but he ain't took yet, and
there's four more stout fellows beside the nigger, and
one on 'ems ekal to any two o' us. So come along, both
o' ye."</p>

<p>"No," said Lyttleton, "you have undertaken the job,
and it's no part of my plan to assist in the fray. I'll pay
liberally when it's done; but as I told you in the first
place, I can't have Clendenin get sight of either my face
or that of my valet."</p>

<p>"Black your faces, or tie a handkercher over 'em,"
suggested Abner's brother.</p>

<p>"No; he'd recognize our voices."</p>

<p>"You're a&mdash;&mdash; coward," sneered Abner. "No use
argufying with the white-livered critter, Josh. He won't
git his job done, 'tain't likely, if he don't help, that's all.
Come on back. P'raps Brannon's there by now, and if
the fellers'll only quiet down to sleep, I for one am
willin' to try it for the sake o' the plunder, and the cash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
we'll have in hand afore we let these ere chaps have
their way with the one they're wantin' to git shut of."</p>

<p>"What a vulgar wretch!" muttered Lyttleton, in a
tone of extreme disgust, as the two ruffians turned and
left the spot to make their way rapidly back to the
house.</p>

<p>They found Brannon there, waiting with the others
for the slight occasional sounds overhead to cease, as
they dared not make the desired attack with their
intended victims awake and prepared to meet and repel it.</p>

<p>But they waited in vain; our travellers hearing men's
voices, conversing in subdued tones in the room below,
understood for what they were waiting, and not wishing
for a fight, took care to let them know that they had not
all succumbed to sleep.</p>

<p>In fact the hunter, listening intently with his ear to a
crack in the floor, heard the woman say, "Not yet,
they're not asleep yet, for I hear 'em movin'."</p>

<p>"Ye do, eh?" he growled in undertone, "well, ye'll
likely keep on a hearin' it till them he wolves o' yourn
goes back to their den in the woods."</p>

<p>At last as a faint streak of dawn began to show itself
above the eastern horizon, the ruffians drew close
together and held a whispered consultation, the result
of which was the decision to give up attacking here,
leave at once, and hastening on ahead of the travellers,
post themselves at a certain spot favorable for an ambuscade,
where they would play the highwayman, "relieving
the fellers o' their plunder," as they expressed it, and
letting them go with their lives if they were wise enough
not to show fight, but taking Clendenin prisoner for the
sake of slaking Brannon's thirst for revenge and obtaining
Lyttleton's offered reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
The first part of their plan was at once put into execution,
and with no small sense of relief our travellers heard
them depart.</p>

<p>"Up, boys, now's our time," said the hunter; "day's
breakin', the thieves has left for the present, and we'd
best git out o' this instanter."</p>

<p>The others being of the same opinion, they hastily
gathered up their guns and saddle-bags, unbarred the
door, and as nearly in a body as might be, the hunter
taking the lead, descended the step-ladder to the room
below.</p>

<p>The woman nodding in her chair beside the smouldering
embers of the fire, was its only occupant.</p>

<p>She started up, saying, "Why you're airly, ain't ye?
I hadn't thought of gettin' breakfast yet."</p>

<p>"Never mind, we don't want any, mother," said Johnson
dryly.</p>

<p>"Why, ye ain't goin' a'ready? ye'd better stay for
breakfast. I'll not be long gettin' it."</p>

<p>"No," they answered, "we must start at once."</p>

<p>"Ye didn't sleep much, I think," she remarked sullenly,
following them to the door.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" queried Johnson, giving her a
sharp look.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was up myself, and I heard ye movin'
around."</p>

<p>Clendenin stepped back to enquire, and pay her
charges for the entertainment of the party, and thought
she eyed him strangely during that transaction, with a
sort of repressed eagerness and cupidity, and somewhat
as if she were trying to estimate his strength, and
calculate whether she dare measure it with her own, and
would gain anything thereby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
He puzzled over it for a moment as he hastened to
rejoin his companions, who were at the stable busied in
saddling their horses, then dismissed it from his thoughts
with the conclusion that it was his purse she wanted to
secure.</p>

<p>It was now quite light and the sun began to show his
face above the treetops, as they mounted and away,
felicitating themselves on their fortunate escape.</p>

<p>"I see now," said Kenneth in tones of thankfulness,
"why that seemingly unfortunate delay was sent me. It
was certainly a special providence."</p>

<p>"Ho, comrades!" cried the hunter, suddenly reining in
his steed across the path so as to bring the whole party
to a halt. "I have a thought!"</p>

<p>"Better keep it for a nest egg then, Tom," laughed
Collins, overflowing with animal spirits in view of their
recent deliverance.</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't, Sam; I'd better by half use it to save
our plunder, if not our lives. You must know, lads,
that Tom Johnson's no stranger to these here woods,
and knows the trail better'n the doc there, and the rest
o' you readin' men, knows a book."</p>

<p>"Now, Tom, my boy, that hasn't an over modest
sound. But what's that thought of yours? Let's have it
at once."</p>

<p>"Listen then. About six or seven miles furder on,
there's a place where the trail runs through a little valley,
between two hills that's covered thick with trees and
bushes; and now I tell you them cut-throats is just
lyin' in wait there, Injun style, to ketch us between two
fires as we come along."</p>

<p>"Then what's to be done?" was asked in various tones
of inquiry and dismay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
"Why, we'll just keep out o' the trap. I'll take ye
round it. I know the way, and though it'll give us a
few more miles, and hard ones at that, it'll be better
than makin' ourselves a target, or rather half a dozen
of 'em, for those scoundrels to shoot at. Won't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," from all the voices in unison.</p>

<p>The hunter wheeled his horse and galloped on, the
rest following in single file.</p>

<p>He kept the trail for a while, then struck off into the
thick woods, and for a couple of hours they had a toilsome
time, pushing their way through thickets, leaping
logs and fording one or two streams; then taking the
ordinary trail again, beyond the point of danger, they
were able to go forward with comparative ease and comfort.</p>

<p>With the purpose to make his assaulting party as strong
as possible, Bill Shark sent Brannon to urge Lyttleton
and his valet to join them where they were to lie in
ambush.</p>

<p>Lyttleton once again roused from slumber, received
the messenger surlily, declined to go with him, but fearful
of the consequences of utter refusal to comply
with the demand, for the message was couched in terms
that make it such, promised to join them shortly, after
refreshing himself with food; and made Brannon describe
the locality and manner of reaching it so particularly
as to enable him to find it without a guide.</p>

<p>The moment Brannon was out of earshot, Lyttleton
turned to his valet.</p>

<p>"What say you, Hans, are those fellows to be trusted
not to turn on us, if it happens to suit their fancy, after
they have finished with the other party?"</p>

<p>"Mynheer, I dinks dey is von bad lot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
"Then we won't put ourselves in their power. Listen;
we will not join them, but will hide in some place where
we can watch their proceedings unknown to them; and
if events don't turn out as we could wish, we will slip
away through the woods and continue our journey, and
so escape their hands. Now kindle a fire and prepare
me a cup of strong coffee."</p>

<p>With no small difficulty, and damage to their clothing
from thorns and briers, master and man at length succeeded
in taking up a position advantageous for the carrying
out of Lyttleton's plans. Shark's party had divided,
posting themselves three on one side of the little valley,
three on the other, and less than half way up the hills.</p>

<p>Lyttleton's ambush was on the eastern of the two hills,
considerably higher up, where from behind a screen of
bushes and interlacing vines he could see all that might
occur in the valley below.</p>

<p>He found, to his satisfaction, that he could also overhear
whatever was said by the ruffians in an ordinary
tone of voice.</p>

<p>The first sound that greeted his ear was a sullen growl
from the elder Shark, familiarly styled Bill.</p>

<p>"What's a-keepin' that thar confounded Britisher and
his Dutchman? I tell you, lads, they're a brace o' cowards
and don't mean to take no share o' this here fray.
I'd go after 'em and give 'em a lesson if I was sure o'
gettin' back in time, but the other fellers may be along
now any minnit."</p>

<p>"I likes to send de lie de droat down off dot von pig
schoundrel!" muttered Hans, laying his hand on the
hunting-knife in his belt.</p>

<p>An imperative gesture from Lyttleton commanded
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Brannon was saying something in answer to Bill's
remark, but the tones were so low that Lyttleton could
catch only a word here and there, not enough to learn its
purport.</p>

<p>A long silence followed, broken occasionally by a muttered
oath or exclamation of impatience, then a low-toned
consultation, which resulted in the despatching of
one of the younger villains to reconnoitre and try to discover
why their intended victims delayed their appearance.</p>

<p>Another long waiting, and then the scout returned.</p>

<p>"Been all the way back to the house," he reported,
loud enough for every word to reach the listeners above,
"and not a sign of 'em to be seen. The old woman says
they left thar at sun-up, so if any o' you kin tell what's
become of 'em it's more'n I kin."</p>

<p>"Must ha' smelt a rat somehow, and pushed through
the woods another way," cried Bill, pouring out a volley
of oaths and curses so blasphemous, and in tones so ferocious,
that Lyttleton's blood almost curdled in his veins.</p>

<p>Then his heart nearly stood still with affright as the
ruffian went on, in the same savage tones:</p>

<p>"Well, there ain't no use in waitin' here no longer.
They've got off safe and sound, and we not a penny the
richer; but there's that Britisher, with a pocket full of tin
that'll come as good to us as the other fellers'. Let's
hunt him up and help ourselves. Easy work it'll be, six
agin two."</p>

<p>Hans and his master exchanged glances. Lyttleton
held up a finger in token of silence, and again they
strained their ears to hear the talk going on below.</p>

<p>The ruffians seemed to be of one mind in regard to
robbing him, impelled to it by their cupidity and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
indignation at his failure to join them according to
promise.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him they had no suspicion of his vicinity,
and presently set off in a body to search for him at
the scene of his late bivouac.</p>

<p>The moment they were out of sight and hearing he
and Hans rose, scrambled down the hill, mounted their
horses, which they had left at its foot, concealed in the
thick wood, and striking into the trail at the nearest
point, pushed on their way eastward with all possible
despatch.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_xxix" id="chapter_xxix">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Clendenin's heart beat quickly between hope and
fear. He was nearing the home of his childhood and
knew not in what state he should find the dear ones
there, for he had had no later news of them than that
contained in the letter written so many weeks ago, and
received the night before he left Chillicothe.</p>

<p>He had pressed on as rapidly as circumstances would
allow, yet the journey had been long and tedious, made
to seem doubly so by his haste and anxiety; for faith was
not always strong enough to triumph over doubts and
fears.</p>

<p>He had passed the previous night some ten miles west
of Glen Forest, and taking an early start entered the
little valley two hours before noon.</p>

<p>It was a sweet, bright summer day, trees dressed in
their richest robes of green, wild wood flowers scattered
in lavish profusion on every side, fields clothed in verdure,
the air filled with the music of birds and insects, the
bleating of sheep, the lowing of kine, and the fretting,
gurgling, and babbling of the mountain stream, as it
danced and sparkled in the sun.</p>

<p>Each familiar scene had charms for Kenneth's eye,
yet he lingered not a moment, but urged Romeo to a
brisk canter, until, as he came in sight of the house, his
eye was suddenly caught by the gleam of something
white among the trees that bordered the rivulet.</p>

<p>He halted, looked more closely at the object, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
hastily dismounted, and, giving the bridle into Zeb's
hands, bade him go on to the house and say that he was
with Miss Marian, and they would both come in presently.</p>

<p>Marian had wandered out an hour ago to the spot
where she and Lyttleton had sat together for the last
time, on the day he bade her a final good-bye.</p>

<p>It had been her favorite resort ever since. Thither she
would carry book or work, or go to sit with folded hands
and dream away the time that seemed so long, so very,
very long till he would come again.</p>

<p>That was all she was doing now, seated on the grass
with her arms clasped about Caius's neck, her cheek
resting on his head, and her eyes fixed with mournful
gaze upon the rippling water at her feet.</p>

<p>Kenneth drew near with so noiseless a step that she
knew not of his coming, and he had leisure to study her
face for several minutes while she was entirely unconscious
of his scrutiny.</p>

<p>His breast heaved, his lip quivered, and his eyes filled
as he gazed; for a sad change had come over the fair,
young face since last he looked upon it, the bloom was
all gone from cheek and lip, the temple looked sunken,
the eyes unnaturally large, and, oh, the unfathomable
depth of sadness in them! And the slight girlish figure
had lost its roundness; the small, shapely hands were
very thin and white.</p>

<p>A bird suddenly swooped down from a tree and
skimmed along just above the stream. Caius uttered a
short, sharp bark and made a spring toward it, and with a
deep sigh Marian awoke, released him, and turning her
eyes in Kenneth's direction gave a joyful cry.</p>

<p>In a moment she was clasped in his arms, her head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
pillowed on his breast, with convulsive sobbing and
floods of tears, while he held her close and soothed her
with tender words and caresses.</p>

<p>"O, Kenneth, how glad I am you have come at last!"
she said when she could command her voice. "It seemed
so long, so very long that we had to wait; and yet you
are here sooner than mother thought you could come."</p>

<p>"I made all the haste I could, dear child," he
answered, "starting early the morning after the letter
reached me with the news that you were not well. What
ails you, Marian, dear?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sick, Kenneth," she said, a vivid blush suddenly
suffusing her cheek.</p>

<p>"But you have grown very thin and pale, and do not
seem strong," he said, regarding her with tender, sorrowful
scrutiny. "Something is amiss with you, and surely
you will tell me what it is, that I may try to relieve you?"</p>

<p>She only hid her face on his shoulder with a fresh
burst of weeping.</p>

<p>A terrible fear oppressed him as he went on questioning
her about the symptoms of her disease, she still
insisting that she had no pain and was not sick, though
she could not deny loss of appetite, weakness and palpitation
of the heart upon slight exertion.</p>

<p>At length her reserve gave way before his loving
solicitude; for she had been wont to confide her childish
joys and sorrows to him in the old days before he went
to Ohio, and could tell him now what she would not
breathe to any other creature.</p>

<p>"O, Kenneth!" she cried, "can't you see that my
body is not sick, that it's my heart that is breaking?"</p>

<p>His very lips grew white.</p>

<p>"What can you mean, my poor, poor child?" he asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
huskily, drawing her closer to him with a quick protecting
gesture, as if he would shield her from the threatened
danger.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried in bitter despairing tones, "I thought
he loved me, he said it with his eyes and with his tongue;
he said I was the sweetest, fairest, dearest girl he ever
saw, and he promised to come again in a year at the very
farthest; but more than a year has gone by and never a
word from him."</p>

<p>His first emotion as he listened to this burst of
anguish was utter astonishment; the next the fear that
she was not in her right mind, for he had every reason to
suppose that she had never met other than to exchange
the merest civilities of life with any man.</p>

<p>Her mother had no suspicion of the real cause of her
child's suffering. Marian had not confided in her, had
never mentioned Lyttleton's name; and the death of the
Misses Burns, followed very shortly by the removal to
a distance of their maid Kitty, had left no one in the
neighborhood who had been cognizant of even that small
part of the intercourse between Marian and Lyttleton of
which Woodland was the scene.</p>

<p>But the ice once broken, the pent up waters of the
poor child's anguish speedily swept away every barrier
of reserve, and the whole sad story was poured out into
Kenneth's sympathizing ear.</p>

<p>It brought relief from the fear for her reason, but filled
his heart with grief and pity for her, mingled with burning
indignation against the author of her woe.</p>

<p>"And who is this wretch?" he cried in tones quivering
with intense emotion.</p>

<p>The answer was so low that he bent his ear almost
to her lips to catch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
"Lyttleton!" he exclaimed, "Lysander Lyttleton?
I know the man; and Marian, my poor deceived and
wronged little sister, he is utterly unworthy of even your
friendship; 'twould be the consorting of the dove with
the vulture."</p>

<p>She gave a sharp cry of pain.</p>

<p>"O, Kenneth, Kenneth, you can't mean it?"</p>

<p>It was hard to see her suffer, but best that she should
know the truth at once. In a few brief sentences, carefully
worded to spare her as much as possible, he told of
Lyttleton's approaching marriage.</p>

<p>She did not cry out again, but asked, in a tone of quiet
despair, to whom.</p>

<p>It cost Kenneth an effort to speak Nell's name, and
something in his voice thrilled his listener with an instant
consciousness of what she was to him.</p>

<p>She lifted her face to his, the wet eyes full of tender
pity.</p>

<p>"You, too, Kenneth, my poor dear Kenneth?" she
said in low, tremulous tones, "has he wronged you too?
Then he is cast out of my heart forever. I cannot love
one so base, so unworthy."</p>

<p>But with the last words her head went down upon his
shoulder again with a passionate burst of weeping.</p>

<p>A storm of feeling swept over Kenneth as he held her
close, not speaking, for he could find no words, but softly
smoothing her hair, gently pressing one of the small,
thin hands which he had taken in his.</p>

<p>He could not forgive Lyttleton at that moment, he felt
that he could crush him under foot as he would a viper
that had stung this precious little sister, and poisoned
two other lives. His own must be dark and dreary without
sweet Nell, and what better could hers be, passed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the society of such a wretch, nay, more, in the closest
union with him.</p>

<p>Alas! alas! hers was the saddest fate of all, and none
the less to be pitied because she had in some measure
brought it upon herself.</p>

<p>In some measure? Ah, was he utterly blameless,
Kenneth Clendenin?</p>

<p>The question came to him with a sharp pang of self-reproach.
He had won her affection, his lips had never
breathed a syllable of love. Then who was he that he
should be so fierce against this other transgressor?</p>

<p>The tempest of emotion had spent itself, and Marian
lay pale and exhausted in his arms, trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>Very gently he raised her, and bidding her cling about
his neck, bore her in those strong arms to the house,
Caius running on before to announce their coming.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenin met them in the porch, her face full of
anxiety and alarm.</p>

<p>"Kenneth! what is it?"</p>

<p>"She is wearied out now, mother, but will be better
soon. Let me lay her in her bed."</p>

<p>She had already fallen into the sleep of utter exhaustion.
He placed her comfortably on the bed, while
the mother drew down the blinds and Caius stretched
himself on the floor by her side.</p>

<p>"Kenneth, my dear boy, oh, what a comfort to have
you here again!" whispered Mrs. Clendenin, as they
clasped each other in a long, tender embrace.</p>

<p>Leaving Caius to watch the slumbers of their dear one,
they withdrew to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"What do you think of her?" There was another,
an unspoken question in the mother's pleading anxious
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Kenneth's answer to it was, "Let your poor heart be at
rest, mother, it is not that."</p>

<p>A cloud of care, of deep and sore anxiety lifted
from her brow, and she wept tears of joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p>"Anything but that," she sighed, "any other burden
seems light in comparison with that. But, Kenneth, the
child is certainly ill, have you discovered the cause of
her malady?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and have brought her a cure which,
though it must be painful at first, will, I doubt not,
prove effectual in the end."</p>

<p>Then he repeated Marian's story, having won her consent
that he should do so, and added his own knowledge
of Lyttleton.</p>

<p>The mother's surprise was not less than his had been,
and her tears fell fast over the sorrows of her sweet and
gentle child.</p>

<p>"I take blame to myself for leaving her alone," she
said, "and yet it was what seemed best at the time."</p>

<p>"I would not have you do so, mother, dear," he said,
gazing tenderly into the patient yet troubled face
whereon sorrow and care had left their deep and lasting
traces, "no blame rightfully belongs to you; and let me
say for your consolation, that if I read her aright, there
is one drop of sweetness in this otherwise bitter cup,
she will never love again."</p>

<p>She gave him one earnest look, then dropping her
eyes, seemed lost in thought for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said at length, "I think you are right.
And she has passed this trying ordeal safely?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Clasping her hands in her lap and lifting her eyes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
heaven, "I thank thee, oh my Father, for that," she
murmured in tones so low that the words scarcely reached
Kenneth's ear.</p>

<p>He stood looking down upon her with loving, compassionate
eyes. Ah, if it were but in his power to
remove every thorn from her path!</p>

<p>That might not be, but her face had resumed its
wonted expression of sweet and calm submission. She
glanced up at him, her fine eyes full of affectionate
pride.</p>

<p>"You have told me nothing yet of yourself, Kenneth.
How fares it with you, my boy? Sit down here by my
side and open all your heart to me as you used to do. I
see you have something to tell," she added, watching
the changes of his countenance as he took the offered
chair, "something of joy and something of sorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I have learned that long sought secret,
and it brings me both gladness and grief," he answered
with emotion.</p>

<p>"You have found her?" she asked in almost breathless,
half credulous astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, Reumah Clark, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait one moment," she faltered, pressing her hand
to her heart.</p>

<p>He knelt at her side and threw an arm about her
waist. She laid her head on his shoulder, heaving a
gentle sigh.</p>

<p>"Now," she whispered, "tell me all. Oh, that terrible,
terrible day. I can never recall it without a shudder."</p>

<p>His story did not go back to the scenes of that dreadful
day on which he first saw the light. He merely gave a
brief account of his interview with Reumah Clark, confining
himself chiefly to her explanation of the mark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
which proved his identity, and her assertion that she had
looked for and seen it at the time of his birth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clendenin raised her head, showing a face
radiant with joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear boy, what glad news for you, what a
burden removed! And yet&mdash;Ah, I am not the happy
mother of such a son!" and her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"No, that is the bitter drop in the cup, sweet mother,
for I must still call you so, unless you forbid it. And,
thank God, we are of the same blood."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my own mother's child by birth, mine own by
adoption, we are very near and dear to one another,"
she whispered, clinging to him in a close and tender
embrace.</p>

<p>For a moment there was utter silence between them,
then she spoke musingly, as if half talking to him,
half thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"I have often wondered over that mark, but could
find no clue to it, for my mother never mentioned the
occurrence to me, and I knew nothing of the mark upon
Clark's arm. Ah, had I known, how much of anxiety
and mental suffering might have been spared us both!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented with almost a groan, thinking of his
lost love.</p>

<p>She saw the anguish in his face and with tender questioning
at length drew the whole story from him.</p>

<p>"Do not despair," she said when he had finished, "I
think the man has told you a falsehood. I understand
woman's nature better than you can, and such a girl as
you have described would never give herself to such a
man. And now the seal is taken from your lips and you
may declare your love and sue for hers in return. Ah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
my dear boy, I trust happy days are in store for you
even on this side of Jordan."</p>

<p>She looked into his eyes with hers so full of loving
pride, tender sympathy and joyful anticipation, that
hope revived in his desponding heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxx" id="chapter_xxx">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>"One thing more, mother, before Marian joins us,"
Kenneth said, breaking a pause in the conversation;
"she surely need know nothing of the discovery we have
made. I once at her earnest request told her of the
doubt, and she was sorely distressed by it; to use her
own expression, could hardly endure the thought that I
might not be her very own brother! Shall we not let
her remain in ignorance of that which could bring her
nothing but sorrow?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Kenneth, we will bury it in our own
hearts, so far as she is concerned, along with that other,
terrible secret," sighed the mother in low, tremulous
tones.</p>

<p>They were silent again for a little, there was so much
food for perplexing thought in the circumstances that
surrounded them; then, "Who is this Lyttleton?"
she asked. "Coming first here, taking pains to ingratiate
himself with Marian, asking many questions about
you, afterward appearing in Chillicothe, having in the
meantime visited Virginia, very possibly Tennessee also;
does it not look as if he had a design in it all, a purpose
to carry out?"</p>

<p>"It does indeed!" cried Kenneth in surprise and
perplexity; "and if so, doubtless he will cross my path
again; perhaps Marian's also; but woe to him if he
attempts further harm to that dear child!" he added
with stern and angry determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
"O Kenneth, beware!" exclaimed the mother half
frightened at such vehemence in one usually so self-controlled,
"if he have evil designs toward our darling, we
must baffle them by keeping her out of his way."</p>

<p>"We must indeed," he said in quieter though not less
resolute tones; "and while I am here she shall be my
special care."</p>

<p>A few days later light was thrown on this dark question
by a letter forwarded by Dale from Chillicothe,
enclosed in one from himself stating that he now had
Reumah Clark's evidence in proper shape.</p>

<p>The enclosure was from England, and brought news
of the death of a brother of Kenneth's own father, the
last of that family.</p>

<p>He had left a very considerable property, to which
Kenneth was the rightful heir, both by law and the provisions
of his uncle's will, in case he could prove his
identity; failing that, Lyttleton, though only very distantly
related, would inherit for lack of a nearer heir.
He had therefore a strong motive for wishing to destroy
whatever proof of Kenneth's real parentage might exist,
unless he could make sure that such proof would be in
favor of the supposition that Kenneth was the child of
his reputed parent, the younger of the two Clendenins
of the Tennessee tragedy.</p>

<p>Hence his efforts to bribe Reumah Clark to silence.
He had visited the neighborhood of the tragedy and
learned just enough to assure him that if any living person
could supply the missing link in the evidence, it was
she and she alone.</p>

<p>If he could prevent her doing so, Kenneth's claims
must inevitably fall to the ground, and by its failure his
own succession be secured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
In his interview with the woman he was made aware
of the fact that one of the children bore a distinguishing
mark, but it was impossible to discover whether Kenneth
were that one or the other.</p>

<p>In these letters, written by the attorney of the
deceased gentleman, Kenneth was informed of the
antagonism of his own and Lyttleton's interests, warned
that the latter might be supposed to entertain designs
against him, and informed that he had gone to America.</p>

<p>These letters and the answers to them were shown to
Mrs. Clendenin and quietly discussed with her when
Marian was not present.</p>

<p>It seemed, in the light of these revelations, almost a
foregone conclusion that Lyttleton was the man who had
so nearly succeeded in preventing Kenneth from gaining
the all-important evidence of the white squaw of the
Indian brave; and while the discovery of the Englishman's
perfidious character gave Clendenin increased
hope that his boast of having won Miss Lamar was false,
it also augmented his anxiety for her in case it should
prove true.</p>

<p>The impulse to return at once to Chillicothe and seek
an interview with her was often strong upon him. Yet
he put it resolutely aside for Marian's sake; so all-important
to her seemed his watchful care just at this
crisis.</p>

<p>And most wisely, tenderly, lovingly was the duty performed.
They were seldom apart in her waking hours,
and he exerted himself to the utmost to comfort and
soothe, to amuse, to entertain, and by interesting her in
other matters, to keep her thoughts from dwelling upon
her grief and disappointment.</p>

<p>It was no longer unrequited love, for she had, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
she said, cast Lyttleton out of her heart the moment she
had discovered his utter unworthiness; but the heart
was sore, nevertheless, and the niche once filled by the
now broken idol, an aching void.</p>

<p>Her newly awakened woman's pride, too, was deeply
wounded, and yet it came to her aid, helping her to bear
up with resolution against the crushing sense of loss and
humiliation; deceived and wronged she had been, but
none should know how deeply; none, save the two to
whom she was so dear, suspect that any such calamity
had befallen her.</p>

<p>Kenneth kept his patient much in the open air. The
days were long, warm and bright, and the two, or sometimes
it was the three, when household cares could be
laid aside by the mother, taking an early start, and
carrying lunch, books and work with them, would seek
out one or another secluded spot, some little glen
among the hills, or some level place along their sides,
or on their summits, that gave them a fine view of the
lower country, and where tree or vine or towering rock
shielded them pleasantly from the too fervid rays of the
sun, and there while away the hours, till the lengthening
shadows warned them it was time to return.</p>

<p>From her earliest recollection Marian had loved Kenneth
with well-nigh passionate devotion; he was to her
the impersonation of all that is good and noble.</p>

<p>Her father had been a perplexity and at times almost
a terror to her; silent, gloomy, his presence ever like a
dark shadow in the house, ever imposing a vague
restraint upon all manifestation of mirth and gladness.
Her mother had heart and mind so intent upon him,
that, while loving her child very dearly, she had little time
or opportunity to study her disposition or win her confidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
She was one indeed respected, honored, looked up
to as counsellor and guide, an authority never to be
questioned, but it was Kenneth, her one brother, who
was her closest intimate and confident of all her childish
joys, sorrows and perplexities.</p>

<p>In his early childhood the father had been a different
man, bright, cheery, pleasant tempered and genial;
the mother able to do all a mother's part by him.</p>

<p>He understood the change and its cause; understood
also Marian's needs, and earnestly strove to supply to
her whatever was lacking by reason of the strange and
sad vicissitude that had come upon the family.</p>

<p>Angus, born in the same hour with Kenneth, was the
eldest child, Marian the youngest and the last of the four
or five who filled the gap between, and who had passed
away from earth while she was still a mere babe.</p>

<p>Thus everything conspired to make Kenneth all in all
to her in the early days before he left home to pursue
his medical studies.</p>

<p>Since that he had been in all his absences her one
correspondent; and except in the one matter of her
acquaintance with Lyttleton, she had been wont to pour
out to him, in that way, her thoughts and feelings without
reserve.</p>

<p>During the last year she had written but seldom, and
the alteration in the tone of her letters, the few that he
had received being short and constrained, had greatly
puzzled and troubled him. Now he comprehended the
cause.</p>

<p>But the old unrestraint and confidence had returned,
and the poor girl found the greatest consolation and
support in Kenneth's presence, Kenneth's sympathy and
love. "Her dear, dear brother," she called him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
he did not intend she should ever learn that he was
not.</p>

<p>Thus cheered and comforted, she soon began to
regain strength, flesh and color; spirits too, till at times
her silvery laugh rang out quite merrily.</p>

<p>One morning, several weeks after Kenneth's return, he
and Marian were out among the hills at no great
distance from home, where they had left Mrs. Clendenin
busied with some domestic duty.</p>

<p>Marian ambled along on her pony, Kenneth walking
by its side, Caius leaping and bounding, now before, and
now behind, now in silence and anon waking the echoes
with joyous bark.</p>

<p>The sagacious creature evidently rejoiced over the
improvement visible in his young mistress.</p>

<p>"Here is Prospect Hill," remarked Kenneth;
"do you feel equal to climbing it? The slope is very
gentle on this side, and I think your pony will carry you
full two-thirds of the way up. For the rest you shall
have the support of my arm."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered almost eagerly; "we have
not been there together for years, and I always enjoy
the view so much."</p>

<p>They made the ascent slowly, stopping now and again
to take in the view from different points.</p>

<p>When the way grew too steep for the pony Kenneth
tethered him to a tree, and lifting Marian from the
saddle, half carried her to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>The prospect here was very fine; looking off from a
precipice two hundred feet high, they could take in the
whole extent of their own little valley and many miles of
country lying beyond it, beautifully diversified with hill
and dale, meandering streams, forest and cultivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
fields, farm-houses and villages stretching away far as
the eye could reach, toward the west and north; while
on the south and east the lofty Alleghenies shut in the
view, seemingly at no great distance, though in reality
miles away.</p>

<p>With a folded shawl laid over the roots of a tree
Kenneth made a comfortable seat for Marian within two
or three yards of the edge of the cliff; then threw himself
down beside her, and they fell into cheerful chat,
calling each other's attention to the varied beauties of
the landscape spread out before them, and talking of
other days when they had gazed upon it together.</p>

<p>Neither of them had cast a look behind as they came
up the hill, so they had not seen a man who stepped out
of the woods into the road below just as they began the
ascent, and stood for a moment gazing after them, then
stealthily followed, not by the path they were pursuing,
but creeping along a little to one side, under cover of the
bushes and trees that thickly clothed that part of the hill.</p>

<p>Reaching the top, still unnoticed, for their faces were
turned from him, he concealed himself behind a clump
of evergreens whence he could take cognizance of both
their movements and their talk, without danger of
discovery.</p>

<p>It was Lyttleton, who had followed Kenneth into this
neighborhood and was prowling about with no very
settled purpose, but with a vague idea of finding some
means of removing him from his path. It might be
that with the assistance of his valet alone he could, if
circumstances should favor the design, carry out even
yet the plan which had so signally failed under the
auspices of Bill Shark and Brannon.</p>

<p>He had spent many an hour in watching the brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and sister and listening to their mutual confidences,
when they little dreamed of his vicinity.</p>

<p>Thus he had learned of Marian's changed feelings
toward himself and how he had sunk in her estimation.</p>

<p>His vanity was sorely wounded, and as blessings
brighten as they take their flight, he began to grow very
desirous to win back her esteem and affection.</p>

<p>Suffering had spiritualized her beauty, and watching
the play of her features and her changing color as she
conversed so unreservedly with Kenneth, he sometimes
pronounced it superior to that of Miss Lamar.</p>

<p>Yes, he began, now that it was beyond his reach, to
covet the jewel he had won, then carelessly and heartlessly
thrown aside.</p>

<p>She had never looked lovelier than on this particular
morning, and the impulse came strongly upon him to go
to her and make an effort to recover lost ground. Why
should he not present himself as having just come, after
unavoidable detention, to fulfill his promise of return,
he queried with himself, forgetting for the moment that
he had told Kenneth he was engaged to Miss Lamar;
thus proving that he was false to Marian; and only remembering
that Kenneth could know nothing of the plots
against his liberty and his inheritance to his uncle's estate.</p>

<p>He would have preferred to see Marian alone, his
inordinate self-esteem assuring him that in that case he
would have little difficulty in re-establishing himself in
her good graces; but Clendenin was always with her.
Therefore no time could be better than the present;
and just then, as if to favor his design, Kenneth rose
and left her; going to the very verge of the precipice,
where he stood for several minutes gazing down into
the little valley at its foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Lyttleton approached her with quick but noiseless
tread, and happening to raise her eyes they encountered
his as he stood close at her side intently scanning her
features.</p>

<p>She uttered a little cry of mingled surprise and alarm,
at which Kenneth turned instantly and flew to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, sweet one," Lyttleton said; but
the words had scarcely left his lips when he found himself
confronted by Kenneth, who with form erect and
flashing eyes, sternly demanded of him, "How dare you,
sir, venture to address my sister after the shameful manner
in which you have acted toward her?"</p>

<p>"She is your sister, is she, sir? That is good news for
me," Lyttleton said, with a malicious gleam in his eyes.
"I am most happy to hear it."</p>

<p>"I am her natural protector and intend to prove myself
such in good earnest," returned Kenneth. "As
for you, sir, I have lately become aware of, not only
your perfidious conduct toward this poor innocent
child, but also who you are and your probable errand to
this country."</p>

<p>Lyttleton grew pale with anger and fear. He did not
think at the moment of Clendenin having received news
from England, but supposed Shark, Brannon or Hans
had betrayed him; or perhaps Reumah Clark; though
she could have told nothing save that he had bribed her
to silence.</p>

<p>A moment he stood shamefaced and irresolute, then
anger getting the better of fear, he turned furiously upon
his antagonist, heaping the most virulent abuse upon him,
calling him coward, villain, supplanter, accusing him of
robbing him of fortune and lady-love, and vowing sleepless
revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
He drew nearer and nearer to Kenneth, as he spoke,
using violent and threatening gesticulations; and the
latter confronting him with calm, quiet, yet sternly
determined face, kept constantly stepping back to avoid
a collision, till again he stood on the very verge of the
precipice; but with his back to it, and in the forgetfulness
caused by excitement, utterly unconscious of his danger.</p>

<p>Whether Lyttleton was aware of it is uncertain, but he
struck him a blow that sent him toppling over, and with
a wild cry, echoed by Marian, the terrified witness of the
whole scene, he disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Lyttleton shrieked, fell on his knees and crawling,
shuddering and trembling, to the edge looked over.</p>

<p>There down at the bottom of the steep descent of two
hundred feet, lay something, indistinctly seen because
of the distance and intervening trees, that looked like a
confused and lifeless heap.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, have mercy! I have killed him!" he
cried, springing to his feet. "I've killed him! I've
killed him!" he repeated clenching his hands and groaning
aloud in an agony of terror and remorse. "I've
killed him, but God knows I didn't intend it!"</p>

<p>He glanced at Marian.</p>

<p>She lay in a little white heap apparently as dead as
the one at the foot of the precipice.</p>

<p>Then with flying footsteps he fled down the hill, by
the way he had come, nor paused, nor looked back till
he reached the spot, some half mile distant, where he had
left Hans and the horses.</p>

<p>The valet, spite of all his natural stolid indifference
under ordinary circumstances, was startled into an exclamation
of wonder and dismay at sight of his master's
pallid, terror-stricken countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
"Mine Gott! mynheer, vat ish happen you, to see
von pig ghost?"</p>

<p>Lyttleton shivered with the thought that he had evoked
a ghost that would haunt him all his days.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said in a hoarse whisper and glancing
fearfully behind him; "there's been an accident; Clendenin
has fallen down a precipice and is probably killed,
and I may be suspected of having had something to
do with it. I must mount and away in haste. I shall
take yonder road and travel east. Do you go and settle
our bill for board, and follow me with the luggage.</p>

<p>"All haste, we must be miles away from here before
the thing is discovered! Fortunately I had expressed
my intention of leaving to-day or to-morrow, so that our
sudden departure need excite no suspicion.</p>

<p>"Not a word of the accident to any one, remember;
be discreet and prompt, and you shall not fail of your
reward."</p>

<p>With the last words he vaulted into the saddle, put
spurs to his horse and galloped away at the top of his
speed.</p>

<p>What cared he for the helpless girl whom he had left
lying insensible and alone upon the hill top? Ah, he
cursed her between his clenched teeth, and wished she
might never wake again to tell of his foul deed; she, its
only human witness.</p>

<h2><a name="chapter_xxxi" id="chapter_xxxi">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>No, Marian was not quite alone; her four-footed friend
and protector would not forsake her, though for a time
he seemed divided between the duty of watching over her
and succoring Kenneth. When the latter fell, Caius
sprang forward with a loud bark, as with the double purpose
to save him and to avenge him upon his cowardly
assailant; but Marian's cry recalled him instantly to her
side.</p>

<p>He stood over her, gazing into her white, rigid face
with a low whine, then he gently tried to rouse her,
pulling at her dress, then licking her hands, and then her
face.</p>

<p>At last she opened her eyes, sat up and looked about
her.</p>

<p>Where was she? What had happened? Where was
Kenneth? It all came back to her, and with an anguished
cry she staggered to her feet, drew tremblingly, shudderingly
near to the edge of the cliff and looked down.</p>

<p>Nothing to be seen but rocks and trees and the little
stream quietly wending its way through the valley below.</p>

<p>"Kenneth!" she shrieked wildly, "Kenneth! Kenneth!"</p>

<p>But there was no answer, and now her eye caught that
little confused heap. Was it he? She seemed to recognize
the clothing he had worn. Oh, he was dead, how
could it be otherwise after that fearful fall!</p>

<p>She swooned again and Caius dragged her away from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the perilous spot and renewed his efforts to revive
her.</p>

<p>How long it was before he succeeded she could never
tell, or how, when at last consciousness returned, she
made her way to her pony, untethered him and got upon
his back.</p>

<p>She left him to his own guidance, and he took the right
road for home.</p>

<p>She seemed to see nothing but Kenneth lying cold and
dead at the foot of the precipice, to know nothing but
that he was gone from her forever, and that Lyttleton,
the man she had once loved, was his murderer.</p>

<p>The pony stopped at the gate; Marian lifted her head.</p>

<p>What, who was that coming slowly and with limping,
halting gait to meet her from the other direction?</p>

<p>She looked again, and a cry of joy, so intense that it
was near akin to pain, burst from her pallid lips.</p>

<p>Torn, bruised, scratched, disheveled, clothing hanging
in tatters, the difficult, awkward, evidently painful and
toilsome movement, as different as possible from his
accustomed free, manly, energetic carriage, it was yet,
without doubt, Kenneth himself.</p>

<p>Caius bounded toward him with a joyous bark of
recognition, and Marian sprang to the ground and
rushed with outstretched arms to meet him, crying, "O,
Kenneth, Kenneth, is it, can it be you? Oh, I thought&mdash;I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest was lost in a burst of weeping, as she clasped
him close, then, holding him off, gazed shudderingly into
his face, so bruised, wan and bloody that she might well
have doubted if it were indeed he.</p>

<p>"Yes," he gasped, staggering and catching at the fence
for support, "I have had a wonderful deliverance. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
you, darling? Oh, the Lord be praised that you are here
safe and sound!"</p>

<p>Their approach had been seen from the house, and
mother and servants now came running to ask what had
befallen, every face full of agitation and alarm at sight
of Kenneth's condition.</p>

<p>But seeing that he was half-fainting, the mother stopped
all questioning till he could be got into the house, laid
upon a bed and his wounds dressed.</p>

<p>There were no bones broken, he presently assured her
of that, but the jar to the whole system, the bruises and
cuts, would confine him to his couch for some days.</p>

<p>Great was her astonishment when told whence he had
fallen.</p>

<p>"How is it possible you can have escaped alive?" she
exclaimed, her usually calm face full of emotion; "it
seems nothing short of a miracle!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with deep gravity, and a far away look
in his eyes; "my thought, as I felt myself falling, was
that I was going to certain, instant death; but there was
a joyful consciousness that all would be well."</p>

<p>"But what saved you?" she asked, in almost breathless
excitement.</p>

<p>"The trees and the sand, joined to my light weight,
were my heavenly Father's instruments to that end," he
answered with his grave, tender smile. "The bank of
the stream just there is a deep bed of soft sand; that is
overhung by waterwillows with very thick, very pliant
branches; and towering above them, from fifty to seventy
feet high, are oaks and other varieties of trees. I must
have fallen first into those, and without striking any
large branch, from them into the willows, and from them
on to the bed of sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
"I was there when I came to myself; how long I had
lain there insensible I cannot tell, but it must have been
a good while. I had a good deal of difficulty in dragging
myself home; could not get to Marian by any shorter
route, and thought to send Zeb for her.</p>

<p>"Poor child! I was very anxious about you," he added,
with an affectionate glance at her, "for I did not know
but the Englishman might have carried you off."</p>

<p>"He's bad enough, no doubt, if he had wanted me," she
cried indignantly; "but it seems he did not, fortunately."</p>

<p>She alone, of the three, showed any feeling of bitterness
toward Lyttleton; with the others resentment was
swallowed up in thankfulness.</p>

<p>They made no effort for the apprehension of the
criminal, and indeed let it be supposed by their friends
and acquaintances, and even their own servants, that
Kenneth's fall was accidental.</p>

<p>They heard casually, in a day or two, that Lyttleton
had been a boarder for several weeks past at a solitary
farm-house some miles distant, but had left on the day of
Dr. Clendenin's accident, travelling in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>The sudden turn affairs had taken proved a decided
benefit to Marian. Her thoughts were turned from herself
and her sorrows to her suffering brother. She was
his nurse; quite as devoted and affectionate as he
had been to her, and, in her detestation of Lyttleton's
crime, she lost the last vestige of regard for him, of regret
of his desertion.</p>

<p>She could never again be quite the careless child she
was of yore, but grief and disappointment had lost their
keen edge, and she would one day emulate the calm,
placid resignation of her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
The change that came over her greatly lightened the
hearts of the two who loved her so dearly.</p>

<p>For Kenneth, too, clouds and darkness were breaking
away, and the star of hope shone brightly.</p>

<p>He at first thought Lyttleton's accusation against him,
that he had robbed him of his lady-love, referred to
Marian; but on reflection he felt convinced that it was
Miss Lamar the man meant; the admission being
unguardedly made while half maddened by anger and
resentment.</p>

<p>It seemed very unlikely that he would have left Chillicothe
just then, so suddenly and for such a length of
time, and without bidding adieu to Nell, if they were
really engaged.</p>

<p>Beside, Dale in his last letter had expressed in strong
terms his conviction that Lyttleton's boast was utterly
false.</p>

<p>As Kenneth thought on these things and remembered
that he was now free to win the long coveted
prize, if he could; as he talked it all over with her whom
he still called mother, his impatience to get back to
Chillicothe grew apace.</p>

<p>A visit to England would be necessary for the settlement
of his affairs there, but the business which called
him to Chillicothe was of far more importance in his
esteem, and must be attended to first.</p>

<p>He took Marian into his confidence as far as might be
without causing her sorrow and distress, and with the
promise of a visit to Glen Forest both on his way to the
sea-board when about to set sail for England, and on his
return, reconciled her to his departure for Ohio as soon
as he was sufficiently recovered from his fall to be able
to travel.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2><a name="chapter_xxxii" id="chapter_xxxii">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>
</div>

<p>Evening was closing in upon the Scioto valley after
a day of incessant rain often accompanied by sharp flashes
of lightning and heavy peals of thunder; the streets
were flooded, the trees, shrubbery, all things not under
shelter, were dripping with moisture; and still the rain fell
in torrents and at intervals the thunder crashed overhead,
waking the echoes of the hills and frightening
the timid and nervous with its prolonged and angry
roar.</p>

<p>It was just as it had grown too dark for those within
doors to distinguish passers by, who, indeed were very
few and far between, and during one of the heaviest
showers, and the most terrific discharge of thunder and
lightning, that Dr. Clendenin and his attendant, Zeb,
came dashing into the town and hastily alighted at the
door of the doctor's office.</p>

<p>Hearing, between the thunder peals, the sound of
horses' hoofs, and Clendenin's voice giving directions
to Zeb, Dale rushed to the door to greet his friend; in
his great delight more than half inclined to embrace him
after the fashion of womankind.</p>

<p>"Hello, doc! are you actually here <i>in propria persona</i>?
Well I must say this is a most agreeable ending
of an intensely disagreeable day. I am glad to see
you; think I was never gladder in my life!" he went
on, shaking Kenneth's hand again and again; "but I
wonder how you had the courage to push on in spite of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
such a storm. Must have had trouble in crossing some
of the streams, hadn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we had to swim our horses several times," Kenneth
answered, beginning to divest himself of his wet
outer garments.</p>

<p>"I'd have taken refuge in some hospitable farm-house
till the storm was over," said Dale, helping him off with
his overcoat.</p>

<p>"We stopped and had supper at Shirley's, and I was
strongly urged to stay till morning; but really felt it
impossible to sleep within five miles of Chillicothe,"
Clendenin said with a gayety of look and tone that struck
Dale as something new in him.</p>

<p>"Hello! old fellow, you seem in rare good spirits,"
he remarked in a tone of mingled surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>"I believe I am; and yet a little anxious too," Kenneth
answered, his face growing grave. "How are all
our friends here?"</p>

<p>"All flourishing at the major's," laughed Dale, with
a quizzical look. "Ah ha! I believe I have an inkling
of the reason why you couldn't stop short of Chillicothe.
But you'll not think of making friendly calls in such
weather. They'd think you crazy, man."</p>

<p>Clendenin's only reply was a quiet smile.</p>

<p>Truly he meant to be knocking at the major's door
within the next half hour. What, live in suspense till
another day, while within three minutes walk of her who
held his fate in her hands? Impossible! 'twould take
a severer tempest than the one now raging to keep him
from her side.</p>

<p>Dale, watching him with curious scrutiny, read all this
in his speaking countenance, yet was morally certain he
would not enter the major's doors that night&mdash;duty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
would erect a more impassable barrier than the fiercest
war of the elements.</p>

<p>"Doc," he said with rueful look, as he perceived that
his friend was nearly ready to sally forth upon his eagerly
desired errand, "I hate most confoundedly to have you
disappointed, but the truth is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! Godfrey, you surely said they were all well?
Has&mdash;has anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, you needn't turn pale, or be in the least
alarmed. It's only that you're called another way.
Fact is Flora Barbour's lying at death's door; Buell's
given her up, and Barbour's been round here several
times to-day, knowing that I'd got a letter and you
were expected, and made me promise over and over
again to get you there as soon as possible in case you
came. You see they have the greatest confidence in
your skill, and can't give up the hope that you can save
her yet."</p>

<p>Without a word, but scarcely able to suppress a heavy
sigh, Kenneth at once began preparations to obey the
unexpected call.</p>

<p>"I declare it's a shame!" cried Dale, "I wouldn't be
a doctor, to come and go at everybody's beck and call,
for a mint of money."</p>

<p>"It's a noble profession, Godfrey, spite of some serious
drawbacks," returned Clendenin, constrained to smile at
his friend's vehemence, albeit his disappointment was
really very great.</p>

<p>Protecting himself as well as might be from the deluge
of rain that as yet knew no abatement, he hurried on his
way.</p>

<p>The Barbours had, like most of their neighbors,
exchanged their log cabin for a comfortable two story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
dwelling, and from an upper window the light of a candle
gleamed out upon the darkness of the street.</p>

<p>Kenneth glanced up at it with the thought that there
the sick girl was lying.</p>

<p>Mr. Barbour met him at the door.</p>

<p>"Thank God you have come; though I'm afraid it's
too late," he said in a hoarse whisper, wringing Kenneth's
hand.</p>

<p>"Don't despair, while there's life, there's hope," Kenneth
answered feelingly. "Shall I go to her at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but maybe you'd like to see Buell first. He's
in here," opening an inner door.</p>

<p>Dr. Buell, who was seated at a table measuring out
medicines, rose and came forward to meet Dr. Clendenin.</p>

<p>The two shook hands cordially, Buell saying, "I am
very glad to see you, sir! You are the family physician,
and I trust will now take charge of the case."</p>

<p>"I should like to consult with you, doctor," Kenneth
said. "What is the disease?"</p>

<p>In answer Dr. Buell gave a full report of the symptoms
and the treatment thus far; the two consulted for a few
moments, then went together to the sick room.</p>

<p>They entered noiselessly. The room was silent as the
grave. The patient lay in a deathlike sleep; and beside
her, motionless as a statue, watching intently for the
slightest movement, sat, not the mother, she was too
nervous, too full of real or imaginary ailments of her
own, to be a fit nurse for her child, but Nell Lamar,
sweeter, fairer, lovelier in her lover's eyes than ever
before.</p>

<p>His heart thrilled with ecstatic joy at the sight, but
her eyes remained fixed upon the deathlike face on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
pillow, and a slight deepening of the rose on her cheek
alone gave token of a consciousness of their entrance.</p>

<p>They lingered but a moment, withdrew as noiselessly
as they had entered, and held a second consultation.</p>

<p>Both pronounced it the crisis of the disease and
thought that the next few hours would decide the question
of life or death.</p>

<p>"Miss Lamar has proved herself an excellent nurse,"
said Dr. Buell, "and has promised to stay with her
through the night. I meant to share her vigil, if you
had not come, Clendenin, but I have lost a good deal of
rest lately and have a very sick patient of my own."</p>

<p>"It is my turn," was Kenneth's prompt reply, "and I
shall not leave her till the crisis is past."</p>

<p>Dr. Buell now took his departure and Dr. Clendenin
found himself compelled to spend some time in attendance
upon Mrs. Barbour, and in comforting and encouraging
the distressed husband and father.</p>

<p>At length he was free to return to the sick room, and
in another moment was standing close beside her who
had for years held dominion over his noble, manly heart,
and into whose ear he longed with inexpressible longing
to pour out the story of his love.</p>

<p>Yet must he remain mute, for no word might be
spoken to break the silence of the room where life and
death were trembling in the balance.</p>

<p>But he stood gazing down upon the loved face till
some magnetic spell forced the beautiful violet eyes to
lift themselves to his.</p>

<p>Ah, words were not needed! His eyes now spoke joy
and entreaty too, as well as love, and she knew that the
barrier which had so long separated them, whatever it
might have been, was swept away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Her eyes dropped beneath his ardent gaze, a vivid
charming blush suddenly suffusing her cheek, then again
yielding to that magic spell were timidly raised to his.</p>

<p>He held out his hand, she laid hers in it and found it
held fast in a warm tender clasp that would not let it go,
that seemed to speak proprietorship; and strangely
enough, considering how highly she had always valued
her liberty&mdash;she did not care to resist the claim, nor did
she repulse him even when, presently, he bowed his
head and pressed a passionate kiss upon the white
fingers.</p>

<p>The patient slept on; the family retired to rest and
utter stillness reigned through all the house; outside
there was the incessant drip, drip of the rain, but not a
solitary footstep passed; it seemed as though they two
were alone in the world save for that motionless form on
the bed.</p>

<p>There came another terrific peal of thunder, yet the
sleeper did not stir, but Nell instinctively drew nearer
her companion, while he with the impulse to protect her,
threw an arm about her waist and drew her close to his
side. Neither intended it, but the next instant their lips
met and they knew they were betrothed.</p>

<p>Blushing deeply, though her eyes shone and her heart
thrilled with an exquisite joy, Nell would have withdrawn
herself from his embrace, but he gently detained her;
she was his and he could not let her go yet; and again
she yielded to his stronger will.</p>

<p>She wondered at her own submissiveness as she realized
to-night that it was a positive pleasure to be ruled.</p>

<p>The hours flew by on viewless wings; it was no hard
task to keep that vigil, yet the physician was not forgotten
in the lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Toward morning the patient awoke and recognized her
watchers with a pleased smile. The crisis was safely
passed. Nell knew it instantly by the glad look in the
doctor's face.</p>

<p>He held a cup to Flora's lips, saying in a low quiet
tone, "Swallow this, my child, and go to sleep again."</p>

<p>She obeyed. He drew a long sigh of relief. He had
been bending over her in intense anxiety for the last half
hour.</p>

<p>"Saved! The Lord be praised!" he whispered,
turning to Nell with shining eyes. Then, taking her
hand, "My darling, my own, is it not so?"</p>

<p>She astonished herself and him by bursting into a passion
of tears.</p>

<p>It was simply overwrought nerves. She had been exceedingly
anxious about Flora and had watched beside
her day and night for nearly a week. After months
of mental disquietude because of apparently unrequited
love, the revulsion of feeling was too sudden and too
great for the worn out physical frame, and this was the
result.</p>

<p>He understood it in a moment.</p>

<p>"Let the tears have their way," he said tenderly; "it
will do you good. I will leave you for a little, while I
carry this good news to the anxious parents."</p>

<p>By the time he came back Nell had recovered her
composure, but was too shamefaced to look at him.</p>

<p>"Well, fair lady, will you vouchsafe an answer to my
question now?" he asked, kneeling before her and taking
both hands in his, while he looked into her eyes with his
own brimful of tenderness, love and joy.</p>

<p>"I'm not worth having," she answered with unwonted
humility, speaking in the whispered tone that he had used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
"That is for me to judge," he returned, with laughing
eyes. "But do be kind enough to answer my question.
Or let me put it in another form. Will you have me,
have me for protector and provider, lover, husband and
friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you will take me in exchange, and not think it
a bad bargain," she said with a sudden impulse, and hid
her blushing face on his breast as he folded her close
with a glad solemn "God bless you, my darling! I shall
be the gainer a thousand fold!"</p>

</div>

<p>The storm was over and the rain drops on tree, shrub
and flower, glittered like untold wealth of diamonds in
the bright rays of the newly risen sun, as Clendenin and
Nell walked down the street together.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the looks or manner of either
to excite curiosity or suspicion in those who saw them
pass.</p>

<p>He left her at her brother's door with a half playful
order, not from the lover but the physician, to take some
breakfast and go directly to bed and to sleep.</p>

<p>"I shall not promise," she answered saucily, lifting a
a pair of bright, roguishly smiling eyes to his face, "I
have not resigned my liberty yet, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah well, I think I may count on obedience," he
said with the grave, tender smile that had first won her
heart.</p>

<p>"I want you to rest all day and let me come to you this
evening," he whispered, bending down to speak close to
her ear, "I have much to tell you, my darling. You have
a right to know what so long prevented my lips from
repeating the story you must have read a thousand
times in my eyes, if they spoke the true language of my
heart."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I am quite content without the knowledge
if, as your face seems to say, it is something painful,"
she said with generous confidence, and sudden
gravity of looks and tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
"Nay, dearest, you shall hear it. I will have no secrets
from her who is to be 'bone of my bone and flesh of my
flesh,' the nearest and dearest of all created beings," he
said, lifting her hands to his lips.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with happy, grateful tears, as from
the vine covered porch where they had had their chat,
she watched him hurrying away down the street, then
turned and went into the house.</p>

<p>"Was that Dr. Clendenin?" asked Clare, meeting her
in the hall.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he come in and take breakfast with
us?"</p>

<p>"I didn't ask him."</p>

<p>"You didn't? Nell Lamar, I'm ashamed of your rude
behavior to that man! If he treats you henceforward with
the coldest politeness, I am sure it will be no more than
you deserve."</p>

<p>A curious smile trembled about the corners of Nell's
lips for an instant, then was gone.</p>

<p>"Flora has passed the crisis," she remarked, "and the
doctor says will get well if she has proper care."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am glad!"</p>

<p>"Can you take my place for to-day? He wouldn't let
me stay, and her mother would kill her with the fretting
and worrying."</p>

<p>"No wonder he wouldn't let you stay. You look
wretchedly tired. Yes; I'll go over presently. You'd
better eat your breakfast at once and go directly to
bed."</p>

<p>"I will," Nell answered with unaccustomed meekness,
and proceeded to redeem her promise without delay.</p>

<p>Kenneth, too, needed rest after his wearisome journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
and long night vigil, but did not seek it till a letter telling
of his great happiness had been written to the dear
ones at Glen Forest, and sent to the mail by Zeb.</p>

<p>Nell came down at tea-time to find the major alone in
the parlor. He looked up on her entrance, with a smile
that brought swift blushes to her cheek, then rose and
came to meet her.</p>

<p>"I know all about it, Nell," he said, giving her a
brotherly kiss. "You have made me very happy by the
wisdom of your choice; I shall be proud of my new
brother. Ah, here he is just coming in at the gate! You
must let me share the pleasure of his society now, and
after tea I will take care that you have the parlor to yourselves."</p>

<p>Kenneth's eyes shone at sight of his betrothed. Sleep
had refreshed her and restored her bloom, and her simple
white dress with no ornaments save a few delicate, sweet-scented
blossoms at her throat and in her hair was very
becoming.</p>

<p>The major kept his word, and early in the evening they
found themselves sole occupants of the parlor.</p>

<p>Then, seated by her side, with her hand in his, Kenneth
told the story of his birth and the accompanying
tragedy; then went on to tell of the removal of his supposed
parents to Glen Forest, and of the life there.</p>

<p>He described his childhood as bright and happy.
Angus and he believed themselves, and were believed by
others to be twins. They were devotedly attached and
almost inseparable. The parents made no difference
between them, and indeed, had no reason for so doing, as
they were entirely unable to decide which of the two was
their own child.</p>

<p>The boys knew nothing about the circumstances attending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
their birth except that at or near that time there had
been an attack by the Indians in which their mother's
stepfather had been slain, and that the shock had killed
his wife; she being just then very ill and weak.</p>

<p>They could perceive that their mother was at times oppressed
with sad memories of that fearful past, but for the
most part she was very cheerful, and they found her ever
ready to sympathize with them in joy as well as grief.</p>

<p>The father was inclined to be somewhat strict in his
discipline, but kind and genial, a parent whom they sincerely
loved and respected.</p>

<p>Nell listened with intense interest; wondering within
herself too, why the doubt as to which of the two couples
were his true parents should have been, as she began to
perceive that it had, a reason why Dr. Clendenin should
feel that marriage was not for him; in either case his birth
was not ignoble.</p>

<p>He paused, seeming for a moment lost in painful
thought, then casting it off with a slight sigh, went on.</p>

<p>"Yes, ours was a very happy childhood till we, Angus
and I, were about twelve years old. Then sickness and
death came into the family, two little sisters being taken
away within a few weeks of each other.</p>

<p>"The heart of the tender mother seemed well-nigh
broken; but alas! the time came when she was unutterably
thankful for their early removal to a better land.</p>

<p>"There were still two little ones, a brother and sister,
left, and within the next two years Marian was born.</p>

<p>"Troubles came thick and fast during the first year of
her life. There was a great and sudden change in our
father. He had received a package of letters and papers
from England, and from the hour of their perusal was a
strangely altered man; silent, morose, disinclined to mix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
with his fellows, or even with his own family, and at times
looking haggard and wretched in the extreme.</p>

<p>"It was a sad mystery to us boys, but mother, who
seemed to have a sorrowful understanding of it, hushed
every enquiry into its cause, and would suffer no allusion
to it in her presence.</p>

<p>"A few months later came one of the sorest trials of
my life," continued Kenneth, his voice trembling with
excess of feeling. "Angus, my twin brother, my second
self, was accidentally drowned. I cannot dwell upon the
particulars, but shall never forget my mother's look of woe,
her white despairing face, as the dripping corpse was
borne and laid down before her, nor the strange unnatural
laugh, the expression of mingled agony and triumphant
pleasure, with which the father bent over his dead son,
saying, 'It's better so! Wife, why do you grieve? I've
no tear to shed for him.'</p>

<p>"I was inexpressibly shocked and very angry at what I
deemed his heartlessness.</p>

<p>"This mother saw, with deep sorrow; she loved her
husband devotedly, and could not bear to have him unjustly
blamed. She felt, too, that it would be necessary at
some time for me to know the fatal secret. So one day,
after the grave had closed over all that remained of our
loved one, she sought me in my room and told me all.</p>

<p>"Her husband was an only child, had lost his father
by death shortly before coming to this country. Of his
mother he had no recollection, but had always understood
that she had died soon after his birth.</p>

<p>"That, however, was not the case, and those letters
from England had revealed to him the fact that she had
only just died, at the time when they were written; died
in a mad house, a furious, raving maniac, having been in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
that condition for many years; also that such had been
her mother's fate, and that of several others of the
family; in short, insanity was undoubtedly hereditary.</p>

<p>"From the moment of learning all this he had felt that
his doom was sealed, and that of each of his children
also.</p>

<p>"I cannot describe to you the horror and fear that
came over me as I listened to the tale. Then mother
told me, oh, so gently and tenderly, of the mystery that
hung over my birth; leaving, while it almost orphaned
me, a faint hope that that fearful curse was not mine.</p>

<p>"And now you know, sweet one, why, when I would
fain have poured into your ear the story of my love, my
lips were sealed. I could not ask you to link your life
with that of one for whom so sad a fate might be in store.
I dared not risk the transmission to future generations of
a curse so fearful.</p>

<p>"But God, in His great mercy, has sent me the knowledge
that it is not mine," he added, with a look of deepest
gratitude and joy.</p>

<p>"And I was at times shamefully angry with you," murmured
Nell, penitent tears shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I cannot blame you under the circumstances," he
said, smiling tenderly upon her.</p>

<p>"And this was the explanation of the rumors that
reached us of some white woman, living among the
Indians, giving testimony before the squire in regard to
some matter of importance to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was Reumah Clark." And he went on to give
a narrative of his interview with her, then to finish his
story of the life at Glen Forest.</p>

<p>The two remaining little ones older than Marian, had
followed Angus to the better land in the course of a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
months, leaving her sole inheritor&mdash;after her father&mdash;of
that terrible curse.</p>

<p>He described, in moving words, his own and the
mother's anxiety for her, and for the wretched husband
and father; the wife's life of devotion to him, the long
years of fear and care, of untiring sympathy and love, of
faith and submission; rewarded at last by seeing him
pass peacefully away to another and happier existence,
for he had gone trusting in a crucified and risen
Saviour.</p>

<p>Marian, still spared to them, was now their one great
anxiety, but he was hopeful for her. She had stood
some severe tests of late, and it might be, he trusted it
was the case, that her mental powers and peculiarities
were inherited from her mother's side of the house, or
her father's paternal ancestors; all of whom were free
from that dreaded taint.</p>

<p>"We have endeavored, and thus far with success, to
keep the fatal secret from her," he said, "deeming that
her danger would be greatly enhanced by the knowledge.</p>

<p>"She has long known there was a grievous thorn in the
Clendenin nest, but what it is she does not know, and I
trust never will. Her mother and I have also another
innocent concealment from her. She still believes that I
am her brother by right of birth; and we do not intend
that she shall ever be undeceived."</p>

<p>"No; it would be very cruel to rob her of the blessedness
of believing that," Nell said, with the sweetest look
in her beautiful eyes, "to be your sister would be the
greatest happiness, except to&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she stopped short, blushing and confused.</p>

<p>"Except to be something far nearer and dearer? Ah,
tell me that was what you were thinking," he whispered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
his eyes shining, as he bent his head for a closer
look into the sweet, blushing face.</p>

<p>"Now, don't be too inquisitive, Dr. Clendenin," she
said, in pretended vexation and pretty confusion.</p>

<p>"Never mind the doctor," he returned gayly. "Kenneth
is three syllables shorter and easier."</p>

<p>"But not so respectful."</p>

<p>"Quite sufficiently so, however. It is Marian's and
my mother's name for me, and I hope will be my wife's
also," he whispered. "Oh, dearest, how soon may I
claim the right to call you by that sweetest of names?"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't speak of that yet!" she said, hastily, her
cheeks crimsoning, her eyes drooping.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, I am very selfish," he replied, "but it
must be very soon or not for long weary months, while
an ocean will roll between us; to say nothing of the hundreds
of miles of land that will separate us besides."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" she asked, with a start and
look of surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>Then he told her of his inheritance in England and the
unfortunate necessity it entailed of a speedy visit there.
It could not well be deferred till the ensuing spring, and
must therefore be undertaken soon if he would avoid the
dangerous storms likely to be encountered in the fall.</p>

<p>"And you must go?" she said, struggling to keep back
her tears.</p>

<p>"Yes," he sighed. "I cannot tell you how hard it is
to think of leaving you just now, or how sweet it would
be to call you mine before I go; and to know that, if
anything should befall me, you would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, don't!" she cried, the tears coming now in
good earnest, "I can't bear it! I&mdash;I think you might
ask me to go with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
"Would you, oh, would you?" he exclaimed joyously.
"My dear girl, how very sweet and kind in you to propose
it."</p>

<p>"Did I?" she asked, smiling through her tears, as she
gently released herself from his enraptured embrace. "I
thought I only suggested the propriety of your asking me."</p>

<p>"I feel very selfish in so doing, dearest Nell," he said,
"but will you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you really want me and will take me."</p>

<p>"Only too gladly, ah, you cannot doubt that, but
have you thought of the long, tedious journey overland,
and the dangers of the voyage?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and how can I let you meet them alone?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my darling, you are the most unselfish of
women," he exclaimed, regarding her with tender, loving
admiration, "and I the happiest of men."</p>

<p>"But," said Nell presently, "you will have a poorly
attired bride. I shall have no time to get new dresses
made."</p>

<p>"Very much wiser to wait for that till we reach New
York, London or Paris," he answered, with his grave,
tender smile. "'Tis the bird I would secure, sweet one,
and I care not for the color or quality of the feathers she
may wear."</p>

<p>So it was all settled, after a little more talk, and in a
week they would be setting off for Europe on their wedding
tour.</p>

<p>Great were Clare's astonishment and delight when she
heard the news.</p>

<p>"Just the match I've always wanted for you, Nell,
even when I'd no idea he was going to be so rich."</p>

<p>"He didn't say it would be riches," returned the
young lady, supremely indifferent to such trifles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
"But I dare say it will. At all events you are going
to Europe for your wedding trip. Won't the other girls
envy you? Yet I don't know, Nell, I should be afraid of
the sea. What if you should be drowned?"</p>

<p>"I hope we shall not," Nell answered gravely, "but
even if we should, I'd rather die with Kenneth than live
without him. And as to the envy the other girls may
feel, I should think it would be because of him rather
than anything else," she added, her cheeks glowing and
her eyes shining.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so!" laughed Clare. "It's a great
shame, though, that we can't have a grand wedding and
elaborate trousseau. Still the means can be provided for
that last, all the same; and it will be lovely to have it
bought in Paris."</p>
